This involves the preparation of financial statements available for public use. Stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, business owners, and other stakeholders are examples of people interested in receiving such information for decision making purposes.\nFinancial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. It includes the standards, conventions and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing and in the preparation of financial statements.\nOn the other hand, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of  accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, consistency in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organizations.\nWhile financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, managerial accounting provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nFinancial accounting and financial reporting are often used as synonyms.\n1. According to International Financial Reporting Standards: the objective of financial reporting is:\n\nTo provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.\n2. According to the European Accounting Association:\n\nCapital maintenance is a competing objective of financial reporting.\nFinancial accounting is the preparation of financial statements that can be consumed by the public and the relevant stakeholders. Financial information would be useful to users if such qualitative characteristics are present. When producing financial statements, the following must comply: \nFundamental Qualitative Characteristics:\n\nRelevance: Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nFaithful Representation: Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error. It signifies that the accountants have acted in good faith during the process of representation.\nEnhancing Qualitative Characteristics:\n\nVerifiability: Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.\nComparability: Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.\nUnderstandability: Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.\nTimeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.\n\n\n== Three components of financial statements ==\n\n\n=== Statement of cash flows (cash flow statement) ===\nThe statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows:\nCash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance\nExample 1: in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:\n\nCash inflow: $20\nCash outflow:$7\nOpening balance: $5\nClosing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18\nExample 2: in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:\n\nCash inflow: $50 - How much WikiTables received in cash for the first table. They didn't receive cash for the second table (sold in credit terms).\nCash outflow: $50 - How much they'd originally bought the 2 tables for.\nOpening balance: $0\nClosing balance: $50 – 2*$25 + $0 = $50–50=$0 - Indeed, the cash flow for the month of June for WikiTables amounts to $0 and not $50.\nImportant: the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.\n\n\n=== Statement of financial performance (income statement, profit & loss (p&l) statement, or statement of operations) ===\nThe statement of profit or income statement represents the changes in value of a company's accounts over a set period (most commonly one fiscal year), and may compare the changes to changes in the same accounts over the previous period. All changes are summarized on the \"bottom line\" as net income, often reported as \"net loss\" when income is less than zero.\nThe net profit or loss is determined by:\nSales (revenue)\n– cost of goods sold\n– selling, general, administrative expenses (SGA)\n– depreciation/ amortization\n= earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)\n– interest and tax expenses\n= profit/loss\n\n\n=== Statement of financial position (balance sheet) ===\nThe balance sheet is the financial statement\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that issues the International Financial Reporting Standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that considers capital maintenance as a competing objective of financial reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELLEN<|>PERSON<|>An individual whose cash flow statement for September is used as an example in financial accounting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM<|>PERSON<|>An individual who lent $20 to Ellen, as mentioned in the cash flow statement example)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIKITABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A company that buys and resells tables, used as an example in a cash flow statement)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>The International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELLEN<|>TOM<|>Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom, as mentioned in the cash flow statement example<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIKITABLES<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>WikiTables' financial reporting is influenced by the standards set by the International Financial Reporting Standards<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
