Of the many reforms enacted through Sarbanes-Oxley, one major goal was to regain public confidence in the reliability of financial markets in the wake of corporate scandals such as Enron, WorldCom and Waste Management. Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley mandated that public companies have an independent Audit of internal controls over financial reporting. In essence, the intent of the U.S. Congress in passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act was attempting to proactively deter financial misrepresentation (Fraud) in order to ensure more accurate financial reporting to increase investor confidence. This same concept is applied in the discussion of fraud deterrence.\nUntil recently, fraud deterrence has not been specifically identified under one common definition. While it has been discussed by many authoritative sources such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid Series, \"Fraud Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No. 99 Implementation Guide,\" (explicitly) The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), \"Internal Control – Integrated Framework,\" (implicitly) and the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts Certified Fraud Deterrence Analyst (CFD) designation (recently merged into the Certified Forensic Financial Analyst (CFFA) designation), an actual definition of the term \"fraud deterrence\" has been difficult to find.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nFraud deterrence is based on the premise that fraud is not a random occurrence; fraud occurs where the conditions are right for it to occur. Fraud deterrence attacks the root causes and enablers of fraud; this analysis could reveal potential fraud opportunities in the process, but is performed on the premise that improving organizational procedures to reduce or eliminate the causal factors of fraud is the single best defense against fraud. Fraud deterrence involves both short-term (procedural) and long-term (cultural) initiatives.\nFraud deterrence is not earlier fraud detection, and this is often a confusing point. Fraud detection involves a review of historical transactions to identify indicators of a non-conforming transaction. Deterrence involves an analysis of the conditions and procedures that affect fraud enablers, in essence, looking at what could happen in the future given the process definitions in place, and the people operating that process. Deterrence is a preventive measure – reducing input factors\"\n\n\n=== Analogy ===\nDeterrence is distinct from remediation and detection. An analogy can be drawn in considering unhealthy weight gain and the actions undertaken in response. Identifying the action(s) that deter unhealthy weight gain is the key to understanding fraud deterrence in this analogy.\n\nWorking Out = Remediation\nA person has already gained weight\nLessen the amount of weight gain by working out immediately after noticed gain\nThe longer the weight gain goes unnoticed, the more overweight they will become\nScale = Early Detection\nScale is used to detect weight gain, before it is visibly noticeable\nDetects nothing unless weight is increasing\nWhen the scale reads a higher number, the weight has already been gained\nRemoval of Causal Factors = Deterrence\nRemoval of unhealthy food in diet\nRemoval of habits that perpetuate obesity (e.g. inactivity)\nIncreasing awareness of obesity risks (e.g. health classes in primary education)\n\n\n=== Deterrence vs. Prevention ===\nDeterrence involves eliminating factors that may cause fraud, whereas prevention involves identifying and stopping existing fraud.\n\n\n== Fraud Triangle ==\n\nThe causal factors that should be removed to deter fraud (as described above) are best described in the Fraud or Compromise Triangle. This idea was first put forward in an article by Donald R. Cressey and Edwin Sutherland. The term was later coined by Steve Albrecht. The Fraud Triangle describes three factors that are present in every situation of fraud:\n\nMotive (or pressure) – the need for committing fraud (need for money, etc.);\nRationalization – the mindset of the fraudster that justifies them to commit fraud; and\nOpportunity – the situation that enables fraud to occur (often when internal controls are weak or nonexistent).\n\n\n=== Breaking the Fraud Triangle ===\nBreaking the Fraud Triangle is the key to fraud deterrence. Breaking the Fraud Triangle implies that an organization must remove one of the elements in the fraud triangle in order to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent activities. \"Of the three elements, removal of Opportunity is most directly affected by the system of internal controls and generally provides the most actionable route to deterrence of fraud\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence).\n\n\n== SAS 99 ==\nStatement on Auditing Standards No. 99 (SAS 99), Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit, was \"the first major audit standard to be released since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley\" (AICPA, Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No. 99 Implementation Guide). While the standard was intended to assist auditors in detecting fraud during a financial statement audit, its application was more pervasive. \"SAS No. 99 has the potential to significantly improve audit quality, not just in detecting fraud, but in detecting all material misstatements and improving the quality of the financial reporting process\" (AICPA, Fraud Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No. 99 Implementation Guide).\nThe SAS 99 Practice Aid discusses fraud deterrence in addition to its primary focus of fraud detection, \"Because fraud prevention, detection, deterrence are management’s responsibility, the new fraud SAS now requires you to determine whether management has designed programs and controls that address identified risks of material misstatement due to fraud and whether those programs and controls have been placed in operation\" (AICPA, Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No. 99 Implementation Guide).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SARBANES-OXLEY ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 to regain public confidence in financial markets following corporate scandals<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Enron was a corporation involved in a major financial scandal<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLDCOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WorldCom was a corporation involved in a major financial scandal<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASTE MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Waste Management was a corporation involved in a major financial scandal<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. CONGRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to deter financial misrepresentation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AICPA is an authoritative source discussing fraud deterrence<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>COSO is an organization that implicitly discusses fraud deterrence<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED VALUATION ANALYSTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that offers the Certified Fraud Deterrence Analyst designation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFIED FORENSIC FINANCIAL ANALYST (CFFA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A designation that includes fraud deterrence analysis<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD R.
