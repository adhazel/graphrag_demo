If expenses exceed revenue then it is said that the business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affairs can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\nAscertainment of the financial position of business: businessman is not only interested in knowing the result of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular  point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\nProviding information to the users for rational decision-making: accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial result of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the financial information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\nTo know the solvency position: by preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\n\n\n== Graphic definition ==\nThe accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity) and financial statements are the main topics of financial accounting.\nThe trial balance, which is usually prepared using the double-entry accounting system, forms the basis for preparing the financial statements. All the figures in the trial balance are rearranged to prepare a profit & loss statement and balance sheet. Accounting standards determine the format for these accounts (SSAP, FRS, IFRS). Financial statements display the income and expenditure for the company and a summary of the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' or owners' equity of the company on the date to which the accounts were prepared.\nAsset, expense, and dividend accounts have normal debit balances (i.e., debiting these types of accounts increases them).\nLiability, revenue, and equity accounts have normal credit balances (i.e., crediting these types of accounts increases them).\n\n0 = Dr Assets                            Cr Owners' Equity                Cr Liabilities  \n          .       _____________________________/\\____________________________       .\n          .      /    Cr Retained Earnings (profit)         Cr Common Stock  \\      .\n          .    _________________/\\_______________________________      .            .\n          .   / Dr Expenses       Cr Beginning Retained Earnings \\     .            .\n          .     Dr Dividends      Cr Revenue                           .            .\n      \\________________________/  \\______________________________________________________/\n       increased by debits           increased by credits\n\n          Crediting a credit                         \nThus -------------------------> account increases its absolute value (balance)\n           Debiting a debit                             \n\n          Debiting a credit                         \nThus -------------------------> account decreases its absolute value (balance)\n          Crediting a debit\n\nWhen the same thing is done to an account as its normal balance it increases; when the opposite is done, it will decrease.  Much like signs in math: two positive numbers are added and two negative numbers are also added.  It is only when there is one positive and one negative (opposites) that you will subtract.\n\nHowever, there are instances of accounts, known as contra-accounts, which have a normal balance opposite that listed above. Examples include:\n\nContra-asset accounts (such as accumulated depreciation and allowances for bad debt or obsolete inventory)\nContra-revenue accounts (such as sales allowances)\nContra-equity accounts (such as treasury stock)\n\n\n== Financial accounting versus cost accounting ==\n\nFinancial accounting aims at finding out results of accounting year in the form of Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet. Cost Accounting aims at computing cost of production/service in a scientific manner and facilitate cost control and cost reduction.\nFinancial accounting reports the results and position of business to government, creditors, investors, and external parties.\nCost Accounting is an internal reporting system for an organisation's own management for decision making.\nIn financial accounting, cost classification based on type of transactions, e.g. salaries, repairs, insurance, stores etc. In cost accounting, classification is basically on the basis of functions, activities, products, process and on internal planning and control and information needs of the organization.\nFinancial accounting aims at presenting 'true and fair' view of transactions, profit and loss for a period and Statement of financial position (Balance Sheet) on a given date.  It aims at computing 'true and fair' view of the cost of production/services offered by the firm.\n\n\n== Related qualification ==\nMany professional accountancy qualifications cover the field of financial accountancy, including Certified Public Accountant CPA, Chartered Accountant (CA or other national designations, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA and Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA).\n\n\n== See also ==\nConstant item purchasing power accounting\nDIRTI 5\nHistorical cost accounting\nPhilosophy of accounting\nAccounting analyst, whose job involves evaluating public company financial statements\nManagement accounting, the other main division of accounting\nBookkeeping\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Annand, Introduction to Financial Accounting, Athabasca University, ISBN 978-0-9953266-4-4\nFinancial Accounting (2015) doi:10.24926/8668.0701 ISBN 978-1-946135-10-0\nJohnny Jackson, Introduction to Financial Accounting, Thomas Edison State University.\nAlexander, D., Britton, A., Jorissen, A., \"International Financial\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
