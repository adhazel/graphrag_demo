Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors; their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand, because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors investigate using checklists and techniques that may not surface the types of evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for in proving fraud. Forensic investigation fieldwork may carry legal risks and consultant malpractice risks if internal auditing checklists are used, rather than the specialized skills of forensic accounting.\nThe fraud cycle describes the process which is taken by those in order to conduct a fraud. It begins with planning the actions of the fraud, which is then followed by the actual commitment of the act, ending with the conversion of the assets to cash. The main goal of Forensic accountants is to determine whether financial crime has been committed, and if so, to what extent. They are often used as expert witnesses to assist the judge or jury in forming the verdict. It is important that forensic accountants possess skills such as microeconomics, cost-center accounting systems, coming up with conclusions with little data, report writing, research skills and interview skills.\nThis process can employ one or more of the following techniques: review of Public records; background investigations; interviews of knowledgeable parties; analysis of Real evidence to identify possible Forgery and/or document alterations; Surveillance and inspection of business premises; analysis of individual Financial transactions or statements; review of Business records to identify fictitious vendors, employees, and/or business activities, or interrogation of suspects, questioning of witnesses or victims.\nForensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, fraud deterrence engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.\n\n\n== Methods ==\nForensic accounting combines the work of an auditor and a public or private investigator. Unlike auditors whose goal is focused on finding and preventing errors, the role of a forensic accountant is to detect instances of fraud, as well as identify the suspected perpetrator of the fraud. Some of the most common types of fraud schemes include overstating revenues, understating liabilities, inventory manipulation, asset misappropriation, and bribery/corruption. To discover these, forensic accountants apply a variety of techniques.\nForensic accounting methods can be classified into quantitative and qualitative. The qualitative approach studies the personal characteristics of the individuals behind financial fraud schemes. A popular theory of fraud revolves around the fraud triangle, which classifies the three elements of fraud as perceived opportunity, perceived need (pressures), and rationalization. This theoretical construct was first articulated by behavioral scientist Donald Cressey.  More recently, forensic accountants have gone beyond incentive effects and focused on behavioral characteristics, a branch of accounting known as accounting, behavior and organizations, or organizational behavior. Certain predictive factors, like being labeled as “narcissistic” or committing adultery, are common traits among fraud perpetrators. These characteristics are often not conclusive enough on their own to identify the culprit, but can help forensic accountants to narrow down a suspect list, sometimes based on behavioral or demographic factors.\nThe quantitative approach focuses on financial data information and searches for abnormalities or patterns predictive of misconduct. Today, forensic accountants work closely with data analytics to dig through complex financial records. Data collection is an important aspect of forensic accounting because proper analysis requires data that is sufficient and reliable. Once a forensic accountant has access to the relevant data, analytic techniques are applied. Predictive modeling can detect potentially fraudulent activities, entity resolution algorithms and social network analytics can identify hidden relationships, and text mining allows forensic accountants to parse through large amounts of unstructured data quickly. Another common quantitative forensic accounting method is the application of Benford's law. Benford's law predicts patterns in an observed set of accounting data, and the more the data deviates from the pattern, the more likely that the data has been manipulated and falsified.\n\n\n== Analytical techniques ==\nForensic accountants utilize an understanding of economic theories, business information, financial reporting systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, data management & electronic discovery, data analysis techniques for fraud detection, evidence gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work.\nWhen detecting fraud in public organizations accountants will look in areas such as billing, corruption, cash and non-cash asset misappropriation, refunds and issues in the payroll department. To detect fraud, companies may undergo management reviews, audits (both internally and externally) and inspection of documents. Forensic accountants will often try to prevent fraud before it happens but searching for errors and in-precise operations as well as poorly documented transactions.\nThe process begins with the forensic accountant gathering as much information as possible from clients, suppliers, stakeholders and anyone else involved in the company. Next, they will analyze financial statements in order to try and find errors or mistakes in the reporting of those financial statements as well as they will analyze any background information provided. The next step involves interviewing employees in order to try and find where the fraud may be occurring. Investigators will look at company values, performance reviews, management styles and the overall structure of the company. After this is complete the forensic accountant will try to draw conclusions from their findings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBenford's law\nCertified Fraud Examiner\nAssociation of Certified Fraud Examiners\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Institute of Forensic Investigation Professionals Inc\nAssociation of Certified Fraud Examiners\nCertified in Financial Forensics\nForensic Accountants, Forensic Accounting Certifications, and Due\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATION PROFESSIONALS INC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Institute of Forensic Investigation Professionals Inc is an organization related to forensic investigation and forensic accounting professionals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners is a professional organization that certifies fraud examiners and supports forensic accounting and fraud investigation activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINER<|>EVENT<|>Certified Fraud Examiner is a professional certification related to expertise in fraud examination and forensic accounting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFIED IN FINANCIAL FORENSICS<|>EVENT<|>Certified in Financial Forensics is a professional certification related to forensic accounting and financial fraud investigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS<|>PERSON<|>Forensic accountants are professionals who investigate financial crimes, detect fraud, analyze financial data, and often serve as expert witnesses in legal proceedings)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINER<|>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners provides the Certified Fraud Examiner certification to professionals<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS<|>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners supports forensic accountants through certification and professional development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATION PROFESSIONALS INC<|>FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS<|>The International Institute of Forensic Investigation Professionals Inc is an organization related to forensic accountants and forensic investigation professionals<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFIED IN FINANCIAL FORENSICS<|>FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS<|>Certified in Financial Forensics is a certification held by forensic accountants to demonstrate expertise in financial fraud investigation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFIED IN FINANCIAL FORENSICS<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>Both Certified in Financial Forensics and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners are related to professional certification in forensic accounting and fraud examination<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
