This involves the preparation of financial statements available for public use. Stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, business owners, and other stakeholders are examples of people interested in receiving such information for decision making purposes.\nFinancial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. It includes the standards, conventions and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing and in the preparation of financial statements.\nOn the other hand, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of  accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, consistency in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organizations.\nWhile financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, managerial accounting provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nFinancial accounting and financial reporting are often used as synonyms.\n1. According to International Financial Reporting Standards: the objective of financial reporting is:\n\nTo provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.\n2. According to the European Accounting Association:\n\nCapital maintenance is a competing objective of financial reporting.\nFinancial accounting is the preparation of financial statements that can be consumed by the public and the relevant stakeholders. Financial information would be useful to users if such qualitative characteristics are present. When producing financial statements, the following must comply: \nFundamental Qualitative Characteristics:\n\nRelevance: Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nFaithful Representation: Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error. It signifies that the accountants have acted in good faith during the process of representation.\nEnhancing Qualitative Characteristics:\n\nVerifiability: Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.\nComparability: Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.\nUnderstandability: Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.\nTimeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.\n\n\n== Three components of financial statements ==\n\n\n=== Statement of cash flows (cash flow statement) ===\nThe statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows:\nCash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance\nExample 1: in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:\n\nCash inflow: $20\nCash outflow:$7\nOpening balance: $5\nClosing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18\nExample 2: in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:\n\nCash inflow: $50 - How much WikiTables received in cash for the first table. They didn't receive cash for the second table (sold in credit terms).\nCash outflow: $50 - How much they'd originally bought the 2 tables for.\nOpening balance: $0\nClosing balance: $50 – 2*$25 + $0 = $50–50=$0 - Indeed, the cash flow for the month of June for WikiTables amounts to $0 and not $50.\nImportant: the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.\n\n\n=== Statement of financial performance (income statement, profit & loss (p&l) statement, or statement of operations) ===\nThe statement of profit or income statement represents the changes in value of a company's accounts over a set period (most commonly one fiscal year), and may compare the changes to changes in the same accounts over the previous period. All changes are summarized on the \"bottom line\" as net income, often reported as \"net loss\" when income is less than zero.\nThe net profit or loss is determined by:\nSales (revenue)\n– cost of goods sold\n– selling, general, administrative expenses (SGA)\n– depreciation/ amortization\n= earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)\n– interest and tax expenses\n= profit/loss\n\n\n=== Statement of financial position (balance sheet) ===\nThe balance sheet is the financial statement\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction, including standards, conventions, and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing financial transactions and preparing financial statements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of accounting standards that specify how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements, aimed at promoting consistency in financial reporting internationally)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is the organization that issues the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and promotes global consistency in financial reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Accounting Association is an organization that provides perspectives on financial reporting objectives, including capital maintenance as a competing objective)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELLEN<|>PERSON<|>Ellen is an individual used in an example illustrating a cash flow statement, who started with $5, borrowed $20 from Tom, and bought shoes for $7 in September)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM<|>PERSON<|>Tom is an individual who lent $20 in cash to Ellen, used as an example in a cash flow statement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIKITABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WikiTables is a company that buys and resells tables, used as an example in a cash flow statement illustrating cash inflows and outflows from sales and purchases)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>The International Accounting Standards Board issues the International Financial Reporting Standards to promote consistent financial reporting globally<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES<|>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING<|>GAAP provides the standard framework of guidelines that govern financial accounting in various jurisdictions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING<|>IFRS provides accounting standards that guide how financial accounting transactions and events should be reported internationally<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING ASSOCIATION<|>FINANCIAL REPORTING<|>The European Accounting Association provides objectives and perspectives on financial reporting, including capital maintenance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELLEN<|>TOM<|>Ellen borrowed $20 in cash from Tom as part of an example illustrating cash flow statements<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIKITABLES<|>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING<|>WikiTables is a company used as an example to illustrate cash flow statements in financial accounting<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
