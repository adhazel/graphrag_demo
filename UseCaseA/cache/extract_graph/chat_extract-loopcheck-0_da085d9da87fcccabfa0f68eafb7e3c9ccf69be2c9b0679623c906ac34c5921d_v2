Managers establish policies, processes, and practices in these five components of management control to help the organization achieve the four specific objectives listed above.  Internal auditors perform audits to evaluate whether the five components of management control are present and operating effectively, and if not, provide recommendations for improvement.\nIn the United States, the internal audit function independently assesses management's system of internal control and reports its results to top management and the company's audit committee of the board of directors.\n\n\n== Role in risk management ==\nInternal auditing professional standards require the function to evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's Risk management activities.  Risk management is the process by which an organization identifies, analyses, responds, gathers information about, and monitors strategic risks that could actually or potentially impact the organization's ability to achieve its mission and objectives.\nUnder the COSO enterprise risk management (ERM) Framework, an organization's strategy, operations, reporting, and compliance objectives all have associated strategic business risks – the negative outcomes resulting from internal and external events that inhibit the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. Management assesses risk as part of the ordinary course of business activities such as strategic planning, marketing planning, capital planning, budgeting, hedging, incentive payout structure, credit/lending practices, mergers and acquisitions, strategic partnerships, legislative changes, conducting business abroad, etc.  Sarbanes–Oxley regulations require extensive risk assessment of financial reporting processes.  Corporate legal counsel often prepares comprehensive assessments of the current and potential litigation a company faces.  Internal auditors may evaluate each of these activities, or focus on the overarching process used to manage risks entity-wide.  For example, internal auditors can advise management regarding the reporting of forward-looking operating measures to the board, to help identify emerging risks; or internal auditors can evaluate and report on whether the board and other stakeholders can have reasonable assurance the organization's management team has implemented an effective enterprise risk management program.\nIn larger organizations, major strategic initiatives are implemented to achieve objectives and drive changes.  As a member of senior management, the chief audit executive (CAE) may participate in status updates on these major initiatives.  This places the CAE in the position to report on many of the major risks the organization faces to the audit committee, or ensure management's reporting is effective for that purpose.\nThe internal audit function may help the organization address its risk of fraud via a fraud risk assessment, using principles of fraud deterrence. Internal auditors may help companies establish and maintain Enterprise Risk Management processes. This process is highly valued by many businesses for establishing and implementing effective management systems and ensuring quality is maintained & professional standards are met  Internal auditors also play an important role in helping companies execute a SOX 404 top-down risk assessment.  In these latter two areas, internal auditors typically are part of the risk assessment team in an advisory role.\n\n\n== Role in corporate governance ==\nInternal auditing activity as it relates to corporate governance has in the past been generally informal, accomplished primarily through participation in meetings and discussions with members of the board of directors.   According to COSO's ERM framework, governance is the policies, processes and structures used by the organization's leadership to direct activities, achieve objectives, and protect the interests of diverse stakeholder groups in a manner consistent with ethical standards. The internal auditor is often considered one of the \"four pillars\" of corporate governance, the other pillars being the board of directors, management, and the external auditor.\nA primary focus area of internal auditing as it relates to corporate governance is helping the audit committee of the board of directors (or equivalent) perform its responsibilities effectively.  This may include reporting critical management control issues, suggesting questions or topics for the audit committee's meeting agendas, and coordinating with the external auditor and management to ensure the committee receives effective information. In recent years, the IIA has advocated more formal evaluation of corporate governance, particularly in the areas of board oversight of enterprise risk, corporate ethics, and fraud.\nSee also § Three lines of defence below.\n\n\n== Audit project selection or \"annual audit plan\" ==\nBased on the risk assessment of the organization, internal auditors, management and oversight boards determine where to focus internal auditing efforts. This focus or prioritization is part of the annual/ multi-year annual audit plan. The audit plan is typically proposed by the CAE (sometimes with several options or alternatives) for the review and approval of the audit committee or the board of directors. Internal auditing activity is generally conducted as one or more discrete assignments.\nIt should be adapted to the specific purpose of audit, and the selection of audit method must be adapted to its specific purpose. Otherwise, it will deviate from the purpose of the audit.\n\n\n== Internal audit execution ==\nA typical internal audit assignment involves the following steps:\n\nEstablishing and communicating the scope and objectives of the audit to appropriate members of management.\nDeveloping an understanding of the business area under review – this includes objectives, measurements & key transaction types and involves interviews and a review of documents – flowcharts and narratives may be created, if necessary.\nDescribing the key risks facing the business activities within the scope of the audit.\nIdentifying management practices in the five components of control used to ensure that each key risk is properly controlled and monitored. An internal audit checklist can be a helpful tool to identify common risks and desired controls in the specific process or specific industry being audited.\nDeveloping and executing a risk-based sampling and testing approach to determine whether\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COSO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>COSO is the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which provides frameworks for enterprise risk management and internal control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARBANES-OXLEY<|>EVENT<|>Sarbanes-Oxley is a U.S. federal law that mandates extensive risk assessment of financial reporting processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IIA is the Institute of Internal Auditors, which advocates for formal evaluation of corporate governance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE<|>PERSON<|>The Chief Audit Executive is a senior management member who participates in status updates on major strategic initiatives and reports on risks to the audit committee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where the internal audit function independently assesses management's system of internal control)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO<|>SARBANES-OXLEY<|>COSO provides frameworks that are used in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IIA<|>COSO<|>IIA advocates for the use of COSO's ERM framework in corporate governance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE<|>IIA<|>The Chief Audit Executive may follow IIA guidelines for reporting on risks to the audit committee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>SARBANES-OXLEY<|>Sarbanes-Oxley is a U.S. federal law affecting financial reporting processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Chief Audit Executive operates within the United States to report on risks to the audit committee<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
