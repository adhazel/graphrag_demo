Money can be laundered by many methods that vary in complexity and sophistication.\nMoney laundering typically involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means (\"placement\"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash (\"layering\"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds (\"integration\"). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending on the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.\nAccording to the United States Treasury Department:\n\nMoney laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e., \"dirty money\") appear legal (i.e., \"clean\"). Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the \"dirty money\" appears \"clean\".\n\n\n=== Methods ===\n\n\n==== List of methods ====\nMoney laundering can take several forms, although most methodologies can be categorized into one of a few types. These include \"bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing\".\n\nStructuring: Often known as smurfing, is a method of placement whereby cash is broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid anti-money laundering reporting requirements. A sub-component of this is to use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.\nBulk cash smuggling: This involves physically smuggling cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in a financial institution, such as an offshore bank, that offers greater bank secrecy or less rigorous money laundering enforcement.\nCash-intensive businesses: In this method, a business is typically expected to receive a large proportion of its revenue as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. This method of money laundering often causes organized crime and corporate crime to overlap. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash. In such cases, the business will usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no variable costs and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs. Examples are parking structures, strip clubs, tanning salons, car washes, arcades, bars, restaurants, casinos, barber shops, DVD stores, movie theaters, and beach resorts.\nTrade-based laundering: This method is one of the newest and most complex forms of money laundering. This involves under- or over-valuing invoices to disguise the movement of money. For example, the art market has been accused of being an ideal vehicle for money laundering due to several unique aspects of art such as the subjective value of artworks as well as the secrecy of auction houses about the identity of the buyer and seller. According to the National Crime Agency, one strategy that is favored by high-net-worth individuals is specialist storage facilities. Art kept in these spaces has been used by individuals to evade sanctions and launder the proceeds of crime.\nShell companies and trusts: Trusts and shell companies disguise the true owners of money. Trusts and corporate vehicles, depending on the jurisdiction, need not disclose their true owner.  Sometimes referred to by the slang term rathole, though that term usually refers to a person acting as the fictitious owner rather than the business entity.\nRound-tripping: Here, money is deposited in a controlled foreign corporation offshore, preferably in a tax haven where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a foreign direct investment, exempt from taxation. A variant of this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, when the money is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.\nBank capture: In this case, money launderers or criminals buy a controlling interest in a bank, preferably in a jurisdiction with weak money laundering controls, and then move money through the bank without scrutiny.\nInvoice Fraud: An example is when a criminal contacts a company saying that the supplier payment details have changed. They then provide alternative, fraudulent details in order for you to pay them money.\nCasinos: In this method, an individual walks into a casino and buys chips with illicit cash. The individual will then play for a relatively short time. When the person cashes in the chips, they will expect to take payment in a check, or at least get a receipt so they can claim the proceeds as gambling winnings.\nOther gambling: Money is spent on gambling, preferably on high odds games. One way to minimize risk with this method is to bet on every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have short odds, and the bettor will lose only the vigorish and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown as the source of money. The losing bets will remain hidden.\nBlack salaries: A company may have unregistered employees without written contracts and pay them cash salaries. Dirty money might be used to pay them.\nTax amnesties: For example, those that legalize unreported assets and cash in tax havens.\nTransaction Laundering: When a merchant unknowingly processes illicit credit card transactions for another business. It is a growing problem and recognised as distinct from traditional money laundering in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United States Treasury Department is a government agency responsible for managing national finances and providing authoritative definitions and guidelines on money laundering processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEY LAUNDERING<|>EVENT<|>Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds appear legal through three main steps: placement, layering, and integration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRUCTURING<|>EVENT<|>Structuring, also known as smurfing, is a money laundering method involving breaking cash into smaller deposits to avoid detection and reporting requirements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BULK CASH SMUGGLING<|>EVENT<|>Bulk cash smuggling is a money laundering method involving physically moving cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in financial institutions with greater secrecy or weaker enforcement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH-INTENSIVE BUSINESSES<|>EVENT<|>Cash-intensive businesses are enterprises that receive large amounts of cash revenue, often mixing illicit and legitimate earnings to launder money;
