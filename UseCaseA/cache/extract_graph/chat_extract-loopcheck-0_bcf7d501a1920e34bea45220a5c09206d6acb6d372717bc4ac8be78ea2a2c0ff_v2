In essence, the AICPA has identified that fraud deterrence can be achieved through the implementation of controls and procedures that mitigate (Mitigating Controls) against areas already identified as risk areas.\n\n\n== The COSO Model ==\nThe COSO \"Internal Control – Integrated Framework,\" (COSO Model) describes five interrelated components of internal control that provide the foundation for fraud deterrence. These elements of internal control are the means for which the ‘Opportunity’ factors in the Fraud Triangle can be removed to most effectively limit instances of fraud. In fact, The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) 2002 Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse reveals that 46.2% of frauds occur because the victim lacked sufficient controls to prevent the fraud. The five COSO components are:\n\n\n=== 1. Control Environment ===\nThe Control environment consists of the actions, policies, and procedures that reflect the overall attitudes of top management, directors and owners of an entity about internal control and its importance to the entity.\" Some subcomponents of the Control environment include: integrity and ethical values; commitment to competence; board of directors or Audit committee participation; management’s philosophy and operating style; organizational structure; assignment of authority and responsibility; and human resource policies and practices (Arens, Elder, Beasley, Auditing and Assurance Services).\n\n\n=== 2. Risk Assessment ===\n\"Risk Assessment is a forward looking survey of the business environment to identify anything that could prevent the accomplishment of organizational objectives. As it relates to fraud deterrence, risk assessment involves the identification of internal and external means that could potentially defeat the organization’s internal control structure, compromise an asset, and conceal the actions from management. Risk assessment is a creative process; it involves identifying as many potential threats as possible, and evaluating them in a way to determine which require action, and the priority for that action\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence).\n\n\n=== 3. Control Activities ===\n\"Policies and procedures, in addition to those included in the other four components, that help ensure that necessary actions are taken to address risks in the achievement of the entity’s objectives\" (Arens, Elder, Beasley, Auditing and Assurance Services). \"Control procedures are also a prime focus area for fraud deterrence engagements; if control procedures are not adequately defined and consistently enforced within the organization, the opportunity for fraud is introduced\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence). \"For asset protection, this typically involves identifying assets within the organization that would be susceptible to fraud, and defining control procedures such that the assets cannot be removed and the removal concealed. Fraud deterrence involves proactively examining these control procedures to verify they are adequately designed and actually functioning within the organization\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence). Control activities generally fall into the five following specific control activities: 1) adequate separation of duties; 2) proper authorization of transactions and activities; 3) adequate documents and records; 4) physical control over assets and records; and 5) independent checks on performance (Arens, Elder, Beasley, Auditing and Assurance Services).\n\n\n=== 4. Information & Communication ===\n\"Information and Communication relates to the flow of information in two directions within the organization. First, information should flow downward to the line functions and provide the best, most accurate information as needed to allow the function to produce the best results possible. Second, information about performance should flow upwards through management, through both formal and informal communication channels, providing objective feedback. Both communication channels must function effectively to safeguard the organization\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence).\n\n\n=== 5. Monitoring ===\n\"Monitoring activities deal with ongoing or periodic assessment of the quality of internal control performance by management to determine that controls are operating as intended and that they are modified as appropriate for changes in conditions\" (Arens, Elder, Beasley, Auditing and Assurance Services). \"Monitoring involves both fraud deterrence and fraud detection activities. First, management(what if some in the management are the perpetrators of fraud- JUDGE -MIDLANDS STATE UNIVERSITY) must ensure that all control processes are performed as designed and approved. Control compliance analysis to verify correct performance of procedures could reveal a control that has been inappropriately modified or one that is not performed as approved; this control weakness could present the opportunity for fraud. Proactively identifying these weaknesses and correcting the weakness is this is the fraud deterrence aspect of the monitoring process\" (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence).\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n2009 IT Audit Benchmarking Study (The Institute of Internal Auditors)\n\n\n== References ==\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AICPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is a professional organization that issues auditing standards such as SAS No. 99, focusing on fraud detection, deterrence, and prevention in audits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS NO. 99<|>EVENT<|>SAS No. 99 is a Statement on Auditing Standards issued by the AICPA that requires management to design and implement programs and controls to address risks of material misstatement due to fraud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The COSO Model, or Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, provides the Internal Control – Integrated Framework describing five components of internal control foundational to fraud deterrence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) is an organization that researches occupational fraud and abuse, reporting statistics such as 46.2% of frauds occurring due to lack of sufficient controls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDLANDS STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Midlands State University is mentioned in the context of management potentially being perpetrators of fraud, highlighting concerns about fraud within management structures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTROL ENVIRONMENT<|>EVENT<|>Control Environment is one of the five components of the COSO Model, encompassing actions, policies, and procedures reflecting management and board attitudes toward internal control and its importance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT<|>EVENT<|>Risk Assessment is a component of the COSO Model involving forward-looking identification and evaluation of risks that could prevent organizational objectives, particularly related to fraud deterrence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTROL ACTIVITIES<|>EVENT<|>Control Activities are policies and procedures within the COSO Model designed to ensure actions are taken to address risks, including asset protection and fraud deterrence measures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFORMATION & COMMUNICATION<|>EVENT<|>Information & Communication is a COSO Model component focusing on the two-way flow of information within an organization to support effective internal control and fraud deterrence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING<|>EVENT<|>Monitoring is a COSO Model component involving ongoing or periodic assessment of internal control quality by management to ensure controls operate as intended and adapt to changes, including fraud deterrence and detection)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AICPA<|>SAS NO. 99<|>The AICPA issued SAS No. 99, which mandates management to implement controls addressing fraud risks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>CONTROL ENVIRONMENT<|>Control Environment is one of the five interrelated components described by the COSO Model for internal control<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>RISK ASSESSMENT<|>Risk Assessment is a key component of the COSO Model for identifying risks to organizational objectives<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>CONTROL ACTIVITIES<|>Control Activities are part of the COSO Model components ensuring risk mitigation through policies and procedures<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>INFORMATION & COMMUNICATION<|>Information & Communication is a COSO Model component facilitating effective information flow for internal control<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COSO MODEL<|>MONITORING<|>Monitoring is a COSO Model component involving assessment of internal control effectiveness<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>COSO MODEL<|>The ACFE report supports the COSO Model’s emphasis on controls by showing 46.2% of frauds occur due to insufficient controls<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIDLANDS STATE UNIVERSITY<|>MONITORING<|>Midlands State University is referenced in the context of management potentially being perpetrators of fraud, relevant to monitoring activities in fraud deterrence<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
