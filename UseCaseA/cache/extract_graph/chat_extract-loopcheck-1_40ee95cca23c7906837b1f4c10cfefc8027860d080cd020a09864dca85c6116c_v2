Forensic accountants apply a range of skills and methods to determine whether there has been financial misconduct by the firm or its employees.\n\n\n== History ==\nForensic accounting was not formally defined until the 1940s. Originally Frank Wilson is credited with the birth of forensic accounting in the 1930s.\nWhen Wilson was working as a CPA for the US Internal Revenue Service, he was assigned to investigate the transactions of the infamous gangster Al Capone. Capone was known for his involvement in illegal activities, including violent crimes. However it was Capone's federal income tax fraud that was discovered by forensic accountants. Wilson's diligent analysis of the financial records of Al Capone resulted in his indictment for federal income tax evasion. Capone owed the government $215,080.48 from illegal gambling profits and was found guilty of tax evasion for which he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. This case established the significance of forensic accounting.\n\n\n== Application area ==\nForensic accountants are necessary for a variety of reasons. They can be useful for criminal investigations, litigation support, insurance claims, and corporate investigations. \nFinancial forensic engagements may fall into several categories. For example:\n\nEconomic damages calculations, whether suffered through tort or breach of contract;\nPost-acquisition disputes such as earnouts or breaches of warranties;\nBankruptcy, insolvency, and reorganization;\nDivorce settlement\nSecurities fraud;\nTax fraud;\nMoney laundering;\nBusiness valuation;\nCredit card fraud;\nSkimming;\nComputer forensics/e-discovery; and\nFraud risk assessments under SOX 404 or otherwise.\n\n\n== Forensic accountants ==\n\nForensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime, and provide evidence to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or money laundering. In the United Kingdom, relevant legislation is contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; Certified Forensic Accounting Professional [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England & Wales) granted by the Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales (FACB), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE - US / International), Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD) by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Certified Public Accountants (CPA - US) with AICPA's [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, Chartered Accountants (CA - Canada), Certified Management Accountants (CMA - Canada), Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA - Canada), Chartered Certified Accountants (CCA - UK), or Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.\nThe Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC) program from the American Board of Forensic Accounting assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993.\nLarge accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department. All of the larger accounting firms, as well as many medium-sized and boutique firms and various police and government agencies have specialist forensic accounting departments. Within these groups, there may be further sub-specializations: some forensic accountants may, for example, specialize in insurance claims, personal injury claims, fraud, anti-money-laundering, construction, or royalty audits. Forensic accounting used in large companies is sometimes called financial forensics.\nThe role of the forensic accountants differ from what auditors do. Forensic accountants are involved with investigating and analyzing the factual information brought about by the crime, whereas auditors handle the gross financial statements. Auditors detect financial deficiencies that need to be corrected, and they give suggestions to investors, based on their professional opinion, on the reliance of financial statements. Forensic accountants examine evidence of criminal offences and through this evidence, make efforts to improve the processes adopted by those affected. Though audits and forensic accounting investigations have their differences, they share a couple similarities; both require knowledge of the practices and processes possessed by the business and the general accounting principles concerned with the particular situation, and they both require the ability to interpret financial documents and be objective and impartial. \nForensic accountants combine knowledge of the law with their accounting skills.  They can assess companies, and help companies resolve issues.  This can help companies prevent corruption, fraud, embezzlement, etc. As with all accounting professionals, forensic accountants performing an audit of a company should remain neutral.  Large companies mainly use forensic accountants when performing audits; however, there are other uses for forensic accountants in companies. Forensic accountants often assist in professional negligence claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals. Forensic accountants are also engaged in marital and family law, analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support, and equitable distribution of marital assets.\nForensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors; their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand, because if the fraud comes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRANK WILSON<|>PERSON<|>Frank Wilson is credited with the birth of forensic accounting in the 1930s and was a CPA for the US Internal Revenue Service who investigated Al Capone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL CAPONE<|>PERSON<|>Al Capone was an infamous gangster involved in illegal activities, including violent crimes, and was indicted for federal income tax evasion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Internal Revenue Service is a government agency responsible for tax collection and tax law enforcement in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCEEDS OF CRIME ACT 2002<|>EVENT<|>The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is legislation in the United Kingdom concerning the confiscation of proceeds from crime or money laundering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC AUDITORS CERTIFICATION BOARD OF ENGLAND AND WALES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales grants the Certified Forensic Accounting Professional qualification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India offers the Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN BOARD OF FORENSIC ACCOUNTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Board of Forensic Accounting assesses CPAs' knowledge and competence in forensic accounting services and was established in 1993)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK WILSON<|>AL CAPONE<|>Frank Wilson investigated Al Capone's financial records leading to his indictment for tax evasion<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK WILSON<|>US INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE<|>Frank Wilson worked as a CPA for the US Internal Revenue Service<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL CAPONE<|>US INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE<|>The US Internal Revenue Service was involved in the investigation of Al Capone's tax evasion<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
