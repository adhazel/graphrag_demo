It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. Internal auditing might achieve this goal by providing insight and recommendations based on analyses and assessments of data and business processes. With    commitment to integrity and accountability, internal auditing provides value to governing bodies and senior management as an objective source of independent advice. Professionals called internal auditors are employed by organizations to perform the internal auditing activity.\nThe scope of internal auditing within an organization may be broad and may involve topics such as an organization's governance, risk management and management controls over: efficiency/effectiveness of operations (including safeguarding of assets), the reliability of financial and management reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditing may also involve conducting proactive fraud audits to identify potentially fraudulent acts; participating in fraud investigations under the direction of fraud investigation professionals, and conducting post investigation fraud audits to identify control breakdowns and establish financial loss.\nInternal auditors are not responsible for the execution of company activities; they advise management and the board of directors (or similar oversight body) regarding how to better execute their responsibilities. As a result of their broad scope of involvement, internal auditors may have a variety of higher educational and professional backgrounds.\nThe Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) is the recognized international standard setting body for the internal audit profession and awards the Certified Internal Auditor designation internationally through rigorous written examination. Other designations are available in certain countries. In the United States the professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in several states' statutes  pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government (New York State, Texas, and Florida being three examples). There are also a number of other international standard setting bodies.\nInternal auditors work for government agencies (federal, state and local); for publicly traded companies; and for non-profit companies across all industries. Internal auditing departments are led by a chief audit executive (CAE) who generally reports to the audit committee of the board of directors, with administrative reporting to the chief executive officer (In the United States this reporting relationship is required by law for publicly traded companies).\n\n\n== History of internal auditing ==\nThe internal auditing profession evolved steadily with the progress of management science after World War II.  It is conceptually similar in many ways to financial auditing by public accounting firms, quality assurance and banking compliance activities.  While some of the audit technique underlying internal auditing is derived from management consulting and public accounting professions, the theory of internal auditing was conceived primarily by Lawrence Sawyer (1911–2002), often referred to as \"the father of modern internal auditing\"; and the current philosophy, theory and practice of modern internal auditing as defined by the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) of the Institute of Internal Auditors owes much to Sawyer's vision.\nWith the implementation in the United States of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, the profession's exposure and value was enhanced, as many internal auditors possessed the skills required to help companies meet the requirements of the law . However, the focus by internal audit departments of publicly traded companies on SOX related financial policy and procedures derailed progress made by the profession in the late 20th century toward Larry Sawyer's vision for internal audit. Beginning in about 2010, the IIA once again began advocating for the broader role internal auditing should play in the corporate arena, in keeping with the IPPF's philosophy.\n\n\n== Organizational independence ==\nWhile internal auditors are hired directly by their company, they can achieve independence through their reporting relationships. Independence and objectivity are a cornerstone of the IIA professional standards; and are discussed at length in the standards and the supporting practice guides and practice advisories. Professional internal auditors are mandated by the IIA standards to be independent of the business activities they audit. This independence and objectivity are achieved through the organizational placement and reporting lines of the internal audit department. Internal auditors of publicly traded companies in the United States are required to report functionally to the board of directors directly, or a sub-committee of the board of directors (typically the audit committee), and not to management except for administrative purposes.\nThe required organizational independence from management enables unrestricted evaluation of management activities and personnel and allows internal auditors to perform their role effectively.  Although internal auditors are part of company management and paid by the company, the primary customer of internal audit activity is the entity charged with oversight of management's activities.  This is typically the audit committee, a committee of the board of directors.  \nOrganizational independence is effectively achieved when the chief audit executive reports functionally to the board. Examples of functional reporting to the board involve the board:\nApproving the internal audit charter; Approving the risk based internal audit plan; Approving the internal audit budget and resource plan; Receiving communications from the chief audit executive on the internal audit activity's performance relative to its plan and other matters; Approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive; Approving the remuneration of the chief audit executive; and Making appropriate inquiries of management and the chief audit executive to determine whether there are inappropriate scope or resource limitations.\n\n\n== Role in internal control ==\nInternal auditing activity is primarily directed at evaluating internal control. Under the COSO Internal Control Framework, internal control is broadly defined as a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following core objectives for which all businesses strive:\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency of operations.\nReliability of financial and management reporting.\nCompliance with laws and regulations.\nSafeguarding of Assets\nManagement is responsible for internal control, which comprises five critical components: the control environment; risk assessment; risk focused control activities; information and communication; and monitoring activities\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) is the recognized international standard-setting body for the internal audit profession and awards the Certified Internal Auditor designation internationally through rigorous written examination<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAWRENCE SAWYER<|>PERSON<|>Lawrence Sawyer (1911–2002) is often referred to as \"the father of modern internal auditing\" and contributed significantly to the theory and practice of modern internal auditing<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARBANES–OXLEY ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 is a United States federal law that enhanced the profession's exposure and value by requiring internal auditors to help companies meet its requirements<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK STATE<|>GEO<|>New York State is one of the states in the United States where the professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is one of the states in the United States where the professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIDA<|>GEO<|>Florida is one of the states in the United States where the professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>LAWRENCE SAWYER<|>Lawrence Sawyer's vision and contributions significantly influenced the philosophy, theory, and practice of modern internal auditing as defined by the International Professional Practices Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>SARBANES–OXLEY ACT<|>The Institute of Internal Auditors' standards and the skills of internal auditors were crucial in helping companies meet the requirements of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>NEW YORK STATE<|>The professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in New York State's statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>TEXAS<|>The professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in Texas's statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS<|>FLORIDA<|>The professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors have been codified in Florida's statutes pertaining to the practice of internal auditing in government<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
