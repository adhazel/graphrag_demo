The U.S. government's 2006 fraud review concluded that fraud is a significantly under-reported crime, and while various agencies and organizations were attempting to tackle the issue, greater cooperation was needed to achieve a real impact in the public sector. The scale of the problem pointed to the need for a small but high-powered body to bring together the numerous counter-fraud initiatives that existed.\n\n\n===== Civil fraud =====\nAlthough elements may vary by jurisdiction and the specific allegations made by a plaintiff who files a lawsuit that alleged fraud, typical elements of a fraud case in the United States are that:\n\nSomebody misrepresents a material fact in order to obtain action or forbearance by another person\nThe other person relies upon the misrepresentation\nThe other person suffers injury as a result of the act or forbearance taken in reliance upon the misrepresentation.\nTo establish a civil claim of fraud, most jurisdictions in the United States require that each element of a fraud claim be pleaded with particularity and be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning that it is more likely than not that the fraud occurred. Some jurisdictions impose a higher evidentiary standard, such as Washington State's requirement that the elements of fraud be proved with clear, cogent, and convincing evidence (very probable evidence), or Pennsylvania's requirement that common law fraud be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\nThe measure of damages in fraud cases is normally computed using one of two rules:\n\nThe \"benefit of bargain\" rule, which allows for recovery of damages in the amount of the difference between the value of the property had it been as represented and its actual value;\nOut-of-pocket loss, which allows for the recovery of damages in the amount of the difference between the value of what was given and the value of what was received.\nSpecial damages may be allowed if shown to have been proximately caused by the defendant's fraud and the damage amounts are proved with specificity. Some jurisdictions may permit a plaintiff in a fraud case to seek punitive or exemplary damages.\n\n\n===== Anti-fraud provisioning =====\nBeyond legislation directed at preventing or punishing fraud, some governmental and non-governmental organizations engage in anti-fraud efforts. Between 1911 and 1933, 47 states adopted the so-called Blue Sky Laws status. These laws were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. stockbroker and brokerage firm; however, these Blue Sky laws were generally found to be ineffective. To increase public trust in the capital markets, Franklin D. Roosevelt established the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The main reason for the creation of the SEC was to regulate the stock market and prevent corporate abuses relating to the offering and sale of securities and corporate reporting. The SEC was given the power to license and regulate stock exchanges, the companies whose securities traded on them, and the brokers and dealers who conducted the trading.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\nRate of fraud per capita for individual countries as reported by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is shown below for the last available year. Definitions of fraud and fraction of unreported fraud might differ for each country.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nApart from fraud, there are several related categories of intentional deceptions that may or may not include the elements of personal gain or damage to another individual:\n\nObstruction of justice\n18 U.S.C. § 704 which criminalizes false representation of having been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of the United States\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEdward J.
