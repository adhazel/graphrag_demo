From operational efficiency to financial inclusion and increased insights, technology has a lot to offer. The way businesses are performed and data is analyzed is changing as a result of technological advancements. Data management is becoming increasingly important. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics are major changers in the accounting and auditing industries, altering auditors' roles. The introduction of cloud computing and cloud storage has opened up previously unimaginable possibilities for data collection and analysis. Auditors can now acquire and analyze broader industry data sets that were previously unreachable by going beyond the constraints of business data. As a result, auditors are better equipped to spot data anomalies, create business insights, and focus on business and financial reporting risk.\n\n\n=== Impacts of technology on the accounting profession ===\n\n\n==== Artificial intelligence ====\nThis refers to machines that do tasks that need some kind of 'intelligence,' which can include learning, sensing, thinking, creating, attaining goals, and generating and interpreting language. Recent advances in AI have relied on approaches like machine learning and deep learning, in which algorithms learn how to do tasks like classify objects or predict values through statistical analysis of enormous amounts of data rather than explicit programming.\nMachine learning uses data analytics to simultaneously and continuously learn and identify data patterns allowing it to make predictions based on the data. Currently, Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) are both using machine learning tools within their companies to aid in financial auditing. Deloitte uses a software called Argus, which reads and scans documents to identify key contract terms and other outliers within the documents. PWC uses Halo, which is another machine learning technology that analyzes journal entries in the accounting books to identify areas of concern.\n\n\n==== Blockchain ====\nBlockchain is a fundamental shift in the way records are created, maintained, and updated. Blockchain records are distributed among all users rather than having a single owner. The blockchain approach's success is based on the employment of a complicated system of agreement and verification to ensure that, despite the lack of a central owner and time gaps between all users, a single, agreed-upon version of the truth is propagated to all users as part of a permanent record. This results in a type of 'universal entry bookkeeping,' in which each participant receives an identical and permanent copy of a single entry.\nBlockchain technology has seen its growth within the financial auditing sector. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger, which makes it reliable and nearly impossible to be breached. Blockchain is also able to verify the authenticity of transactions in real time, giving it the ability to alert necessary parties for fraud. This helps improve the audit process and the accuracy of the audit. Before, auditors had to manually go through thousands of entries in a sample and now with blockchain technology, every single transaction is verified as soon as it is entered.\n\n\n==== Cyber security ====\nCyber security protects networks, systems, devices, and data from attack, unauthorized access, and harm. Cyber security best practices also include a broader range of operations such as monitoring IT infrastructures, detecting attacks or breaches, and responding to security failures. The spread of cyber risk across all organizational activities, the external nature of many of the risks, and the rate of change in the risk are just a few of the issues that organizations face in developing effective risk management around cyber security.\nNumerous banks and financial organizations are studying blockchain security solutions as a means of mitigating risk, cyber risks, and fraud. While these latter systems are less susceptible to cyberattacks that may bring the entire network down, security concerns remain, as a successful hack would allow access to not just the data saved at a particular point, but to all data in the digital ledger.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DELOITTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deloitte is a global professional services firm using machine learning tools such as Argus to aid in financial auditing by reading and scanning documents to identify key contract terms and anomalies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) is a multinational professional services network employing machine learning technology called Halo to analyze journal entries in accounting books to identify areas of concern)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Argus is a software used by Deloitte that reads and scans documents to identify key contract terms and outliers within financial auditing documents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Halo is a machine learning technology used by PricewaterhouseCoopers to analyze journal entries in accounting books for auditing purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>EVENT<|>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that fundamentally changes how records are created, maintained, and updated, providing a permanent, verified record that improves audit accuracy and fraud detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYBER SECURITY<|>EVENT<|>Cyber security encompasses practices and technologies to protect networks, systems, devices, and data from attacks, unauthorized access, and harm, including monitoring, detection, and response to security failures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL AUDITING<|>EVENT<|>Financial auditing is the process of examining financial records and transactions, increasingly enhanced by technologies such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, and cyber security)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELOITTE<|>ARGUS<|>Deloitte uses Argus software to enhance financial auditing by identifying key contract terms and anomalies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS<|>HALO<|>PricewaterhouseCoopers employs Halo technology to analyze journal entries and detect concerns in financial auditing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>FINANCIAL AUDITING<|>Blockchain technology is increasingly used in financial auditing to verify transactions in real time and improve audit accuracy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYBER SECURITY<|>FINANCIAL AUDITING<|>Cyber security practices are critical to protecting financial auditing processes and data from cyberattacks and fraud<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELOITTE<|>FINANCIAL AUDITING<|>Deloitte applies advanced technologies including machine learning to improve financial auditing processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS<|>FINANCIAL AUDITING<|>PricewaterhouseCoopers integrates machine learning tools to enhance the financial auditing process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOCKCHAIN<|>CYBER SECURITY<|>Blockchain's decentralized ledger system offers security benefits but still requires cyber security measures to mitigate risks of hacking and fraud<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
