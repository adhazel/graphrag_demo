The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\n The statement can be used to help show the financial position of a company because liability accounts are external claims on the firm's assets while equity accounts are internal claims on the firm's assets. \nAccounting standards often set out a general format that companies are expected to follow when presenting their balance sheets. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) normally require that companies report current assets and liabilities separately from non-current amounts. A GAAP-compliant balance sheet must list assets and liabilities based on decreasing liquidity, from most liquid to least liquid. As a result, current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by non-current assets/liabilities. However, an IFRS-compliant balance sheet must list assets/liabilities based on increasing liquidity, from least liquid to most liquid. As a result, non-current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by current assets/liabilities.\nCurrent assets are the most liquid assets of a firm, which are expected to be realized within a 12-month period. Current assets include:\n\ncash - physical money\naccounts receivable - revenues earned but not yet collected\nMerchandise inventory - consists of goods and services a firm currently owns until it ends up getting sold\nInvestee companies - expected to be held less than one financial period\nprepaid expenses - expenses paid for in advance for use during that year\nNon-current assets include fixed or long-term assets and intangible assets: \n\nfixed (long term) assets\nproperty\nbuilding\nequipment (such as factory machinery)\nintangible assets\ncopyrights\ntrademarks\npatents\ngoodwill\nLiabilities include:\n\ncurrent liabilities\ntrade accounts payable\ndividends payable\nemployee salaries payable\ninterest (e.g. on debt) payable\nlong term liabilities\nmortgage notes payable\nbonds payable\nOwner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.\n\n\n==== Statement of retained earnings (statement of changes in equity) ====\nThis statement is additional to the three main statements described above. It shows how the distribution of income and transfer of dividends affects the wealth of shareholders in the company. The concept of retained earnings means profits of previous years that are accumulated till current period. Basic proforma for this statement is as follows:\nRetained earnings at the beginning of period\n+ Net Income for the period\n- Dividends\n= Retained earnings at the end of period.\n\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n\n\n=== The stable measuring assumption ===\nOne of the basic principles in accounting is \"The Measuring Unit principle\": The unit of measure in accounting shall be the base money unit of the most relevant currency. This principle also assumes the unit of measure is stable; that is, changes in its general purchasing power are not considered sufficiently important to require adjustments to the basic financial statements.\"\nHistorical Cost Accounting, i.e., financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units, is based on the stable measuring unit assumption under which accountants simply assume that money, the monetary unit of measure, is perfectly stable in real value for the purpose of measuring (1) monetary items not inflation-indexed daily in terms of the Daily CPI and (2) constant real value non-monetary items not updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI during low and high inflation and deflation.\n\n\n=== Units of constant purchasing power ===\nThe stable monetary unit assumption is not applied during hyperinflation. IFRS requires entities to implement capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\nFinancial accountants produce financial statements based on the accounting standards in a given jurisdiction. These standards may be the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a respective country, which are typically issued by a national standard setter, or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nFinancial accounting serves the following purposes:\n\nproducing general purpose financial statements\nproducing information used by the management of a business entity for decision making, planning and performance evaluation\nproducing financial statements for meeting regulatory requirements.\n\n\n== Objectives of financial accounting ==\nSystematic recording of transactions: basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions (i.e. book-keeping).  These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\nAscertainment of result of above recorded transactions: accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the result of business operations for a particular period of time. If expenses exceed revenue then it is said that the business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affairs can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\nAscertainment of the financial position of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are accounting standards that require companies to report financial information in a specific format, including the separation of current and non-current assets and liabilities<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a set of accounting standards used in a specific country to ensure consistency in financial reporting<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issues the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is responsible for setting global accounting standards<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD<|>The International Accounting Standards Board issues the International Financial Reporting Standards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES<|>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS<|>Both GAAP and IFRS are sets of accounting standards used for financial reporting, but they are issued by different organizations and may be used in different jurisdictions<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
