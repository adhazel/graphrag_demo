The Chief of the National Audit Office (NAO), Sir Anyas Morse has also said \"For too long, as a low-value but high-volume crime, online fraud has been overlooked by government, law enforcement and industry. It is now the most commonly experienced crime in England and Wales and demands an urgent response.\"\nHM Treasury issued guidance to central government departments in January 2011 concerned with \"Tackling Internal Fraud\", concerned that economic pressures and potential staff redundancies at the time might lead those staff who \"might be tempted\" to commit fraud to make more of any opportunity which might arise, noting a possible shift in the balance between \"the reward from fraud\" and the risk of detection. An aspect of the guidance was to equip staff to look out for \"fraud indicators\": clues or hints that an individual member of staff, team or area of activity might need \"a closer look\".: Section 4.16 \nIn 2022, the television program Scam Interceptors revealed that the majority of fraud in the United Kingdom was perpetrated by industrial-scale scamming call centres in Asia.\n\n\n===== England, Wales, and Northern Ireland =====\nSince 2007, fraud in England and Wales and Northern Ireland has been covered by the Fraud Act 2006. The Act was given royal assent on 8 November 2006, and came into effect on 15 January 2007. The Act gives a statutory definition of the criminal offence of fraud, defining it in three classes—fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose information, and fraud by abuse of position. It provides that a person found guilty of fraud is liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction, or a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years on conviction on indictment. This Act largely replaces the laws relating to obtaining property by deception, obtaining a pecuniary advantage and other offences that were created under the Theft Act 1978.\n\n\n====== Serious Fraud Office ======\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office is an arm of the Government of the United Kingdom, accountable to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The National Fraud Authority (NFA) was, until 2014, a government agency coordinating the counter-fraud response in the UK. Cifas is a British fraud prevention service, a not-for-profit membership organization for all sectors that enables organizations to share and access fraud data using their databases. Cifas is dedicated to the prevention of fraud, including internal fraud by staff, and the identification of financial and related crime.\n\n\n===== Scotland =====\nIn Scots law, fraud is covered under the common law and a number of statutory offences. The main fraud offences are common law fraud, uttering, embezzlement, and statutory fraud. The Fraud Act 2006 does not apply in Scotland.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\n\n==== Canada ====\nSection 380(1) of the Criminal Code provides the general definition of fraud in Canada:\n\n380. (1) Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security or any service,\n\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding fourteen years, where the subject-matter of the offence is a testamentary instrument or the value of the subject-matter of the offence exceeds five thousand dollars; or\n(b) is guilty\n(i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or\n(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction, where the value of the subject-matter of the offence does not exceed five thousand dollars.\n\nIn addition to the penalties outlined above, the court can also issue a prohibition order under s. 380.2 (preventing a person from \"seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, or becoming or being a volunteer in any capacity, that involves having authority over the real property, money or valuable security of another person\"). It can also make a restitution order under s. 380.3. The Canadian courts have held that the offence consists of two distinct elements:\n\nA prohibited act of deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. In the absence of deceit or falsehood, the courts will look objectively for a \"dishonest act\"; and\nThe deprivation must be caused by the prohibited act, and deprivation must relate to property, money, valuable security, or any service.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has held that deprivation is satisfied on proof of detriment, prejudice or risk of prejudice; there does not have to be actual loss. Deprivation of confidential information, in the nature of a trade secret or copyrighted material that has commercial value, has also been held to fall within the scope of the offence.\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\n\n===== Criminal fraud =====\nThe proof requirements for criminal fraud charges in the United States are essentially the same as the requirements for other crimes: guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Throughout the United States fraud charges can be misdemeanours or felonies depending on the amount of loss involved. High-value fraud can also trigger additional penalties. For example, in California, losses of $500,000 or more will result in an extra two, three, or five years in prison in addition to the regular penalty for the fraud. The U.S. government's 2006 fraud review concluded that fraud is a significantly under-reported crime, and while various agencies and organizations were attempting to tackle the issue, greater cooperation was needed to achieve a real impact in the public sector. The scale of the problem pointed to the need for a small but high-powered body to bring together the numerous counter-f\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Office for National Statistics is a UK government department responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population, and society at national, regional, and local levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIR ANYAS MORSE<|>PERSON<|>Sir Anyas Morse is the Chief of the National Audit Office, who has commented on the oversight of online fraud by government and law enforcement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Audit Office is an independent parliamentary body in the UK responsible for auditing government departments and agencies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HM TREASURY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HM Treasury is the UK government's economic and finance ministry, responsible for public finance policy and economic policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCAM INTERCEPTORS<|>EVENT<|>Scam Interceptors is a television program that revealed the scale of fraud perpetrated by call centers in Asia targeting the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is a country in Europe where fraud is a significant issue, as discussed in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>England is a country within the United Kingdom where fraud is addressed by the Fraud Act 2006)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALES<|>GEO<|>Wales is a country within the United Kingdom where fraud is addressed by the Fraud Act 2006)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHERN IRELAND<|>GEO<|>Northern Ireland is a country within the United Kingdom where fraud is addressed by the Fraud Act 2006)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRAUD ACT 2006<|>EVENT<|>The Fraud Act 2006 is legislation in the UK that defines the criminal offence of fraud and its penalties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Serious Fraud Office is a UK government department responsible for investigating and prosecuting serious or complex fraud and corruption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL FRAUD AUTHORITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Fraud Authority was a UK government agency coordinating the counter-fraud response until 2014)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIFAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cifas is a British fraud prevention service that enables organizations to share and access fraud data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTLAND<|>GEO<|>Scotland is a country within the United Kingdom where fraud is covered under common law and statutory offences, not the Fraud Act 2006)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>Canada is a country in North America with its own legal definition and penalties for fraud under the Criminal Code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country in North America where fraud charges can be misdemeanours or felonies, with varying penalties)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIR ANYAS MORSE<|>NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE<|>Sir Anyas Morse is the Chief of the National Audit Office<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>The Office for National Statistics is a UK government department<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HM TREASURY<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>HM Treasury is the UK government's economic and finance ministry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCAM INTERCEPTORS<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>Scam Interceptors revealed fraud targeting the UK<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRAUD ACT 2006<|>ENGLAND<|>The Fraud Act 2006 applies to England<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRAUD ACT 2006<|>WALES<|>The Fraud Act 2006 applies to Wales<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRAUD ACT 2006<|>NORTHERN IRELAND<|>The Fraud Act 2006 applies to Northern Ireland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>The Serious Fraud Office is a UK government department<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL FRAUD AUTHORITY<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>The National Fraud Authority was a UK government agency<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIFAS<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>Cifas is a British fraud prevention service<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTLAND<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>Scotland is part of the United Kingdom<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANADA<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>Canada is a country in North America<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>NORTH AMERICA<|>The United States is a country in North America<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
