The losing bets will remain hidden.\nBlack salaries: A company may have unregistered employees without written contracts and pay them cash salaries. Dirty money might be used to pay them.\nTax amnesties: For example, those that legalize unreported assets and cash in tax havens.\nTransaction Laundering: When a merchant unknowingly processes illicit credit card transactions for another business. It is a growing problem and recognised as distinct from traditional money laundering in using the payments ecosystem to hide that the transaction even occurred (e.g. the use of fake front websites). Also known as \"undisclosed aggregation\" or \"factoring\".\nOnline job marketplaces such as Freelancer.com and Fiverr, which accept funds from clients and hold them in escrow to pay freelancers.  A money launderer can post a token job on one of these sites, and send the money for the site to hold in escrow. The launderer (or his associate) can then sign on as a freelancer (using a different account and IP address), accept and complete the job, and be paid the funds.\nThrough Sports: Investigation teams have identified sport profits as a common way to launder money. In Latin America, in particular, drug traffickers are frequently found to own Soccer Clubs, and to launder money through their intermediate, by buying and selling players, selling tickets and merchandise.\n\n\n==== Digital electronic money ====\n\nIn theory, electronic money should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts.  In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention.  While some cryptocurrencies under recent development have aimed to provide more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed — and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts — is controversial. Solutions such as ZCash and Monero ― known as privacy coins ― are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information (ring signatures). While not suitable for large-scale crimes, privacy coins like Monero are suitable for laundering money made through small-scale crimes.\nApart from traditional cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are also commonly used in connection with money laundering activities. NFTs are often used to perform Wash Trading by creating several different wallets for one individual, generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party. According to a report by Chainalysis, these types of wash trades are becoming increasingly popular among money launderers especially due to the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces. Auction platforms for NFT sales may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.\nAdditionally, cryptocurrency mixers have been increasingly used by cybercriminals over the past decade to launder funds. A mixer blends the cryptocurrencies of many users together to obfuscate the origins and owners of funds, enabling a greater degree of privacy on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although not explicitly illegal in many jurisdictions, the legality of mixers is controversial. The use of the mixer Tornado Cash in the laundering of funds by the Lazarus Group led the Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction it, prompting some users to sue the Treasury Department. Proponents have argued mixers allow users to protect their privacy and that the government lacks the authority to restrict access to decentralized software. In the United States, FinCEN requires mixers to register as money service businesses.\nIn 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into a digital currency called Liberty Reserve, and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve, charging its founder and various others with money laundering.\nAnother increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as Second Life and World of Warcraft, it is possible to convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash that can later be converted back into money.\nTo avoid the usage of decentralized digital money such as Bitcoin for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation's anti-money laundering laws. The characteristics of Bitcoin—it is completely deterministic, protocol-based and can be difficult to censor—make it possible to circumvent national laws using services like Tor to obfuscate transaction origins. Bitcoin relies completely on cryptography, not on a central entity running under a KYC framework. There are several cases in which criminals have cashed out a significant amount of Bitcoin after ransomware attacks, drug dealings, cyber fraud and gunrunning. However, many digital currency exchanges are now operating KYC programs under threat of regulation from the jurisdictions they operate.\n\n\n==== Reverse money laundering ====\n\nReverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay \"under-the-table\" salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascua alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FREELANCER.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Freelancer.com is an online job marketplace that accepts funds from clients and holds them in escrow to pay freelancers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIVERR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fiverr is an online job marketplace that accepts funds from clients and holds them in escrow to pay freelancers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAINALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chainalysis is a company that provides reports on money laundering activities, including the use of NFTs for wash trading)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORNADO CASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency mixer that was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control for its use in laundering funds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAZARUS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lazarus Group is a cybercriminal organization known for using Tornado Cash to launder funds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Office of Foreign Assets Control is a U.S. government agency that sanctioned Tornado Cash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINCEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FinCEN is a U.S. government agency that requires cryptocurrency mixers to register as money service businesses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESSEC ISIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESSEC ISIS is an institution where Jean-Loup Richet is a research fellow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is an organization for which Jean-Loup Richet wrote a report on cybercriminal techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBERTY RESERVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liberty Reserve was a digital currency exchanger service shut down by U.S. authorities for money laundering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is planning to strengthen its anti-money laundering laws to prevent the misuse of digital currencies like Bitcoin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States has taken actions against Liberty Reserve and Tornado Cash for money laundering activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEAN-LOUP RICHET<|>PERSON<|>Jean-Loup Richet is a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS who surveyed cybercriminal techniques for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMMANUEL V.
