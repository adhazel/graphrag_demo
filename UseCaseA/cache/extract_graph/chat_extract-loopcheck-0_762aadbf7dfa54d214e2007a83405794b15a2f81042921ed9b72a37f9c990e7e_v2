These practices came by way of British and Scottish investors who wanted to stay more informed on their American investments. Around this same time, an American accounting system was taking root.\nWithin the next 10 years (1896), professionals had the opportunity to become accredited by obtaining a license to become a Certified Public Accountant. Copious amounts of the auditing work done at the end of the 19th century were by chartered accountants from England and Scotland. This included the work of Arthur Young, Edwin Guthrie, and James T. Anyon.\nIn the 1910s financial audits came under scrutiny for their unstandardized practices of accounting for various items, including tangible and intangible assets. Notably was the article \"The Abuse of the Audit in Selling Securities\" written by Alexander Smith in 1912, the article detailed the flaws of the auditing system. While others in the industry agreed with Smith's comments, many believed standardization was impossible.\nAs the reputation of accounting firms grew, federal agencies began to seek out their advice. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Reserve Board inquired about auditing procedures by requesting a technical memorandum in 1917. The Institute provided this guidance, which was to be published by the Federal Reserve Board as a bulletin. The Board and FTC each had their own agenda by requesting this memorandum. The former wanted to inform bankers on how important it was to obtain audited financial statements from borrowers, whilst the latter was to encourage uniform accounting. This bulletin included information about recommended auditing procedures in addition to the format for the profit and loss statement and the balance sheet. The memorandum was revised and published making it the first authoritative guidance published in the United States in regard to auditing procedures.\nIt was not until 1932, when the New York Stock Exchange began requiring financial audits, that the practice started to standardize. It did not become a requirement for newly listed companies until 1933 when the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The latter created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which required all current and new registrants to have audited financial statements. In doing so, the services that CPAs could provide became more valued and requested.\nIn the United States, the accounting and auditing profession reached its peak from the 1940s to the 1960s. The SEC was reliant on the Institute for the auditing procedures used by accounting firms during engagements. Additionally, in 1947 a committee from the Institute advocated for \"generally accepted auditing standards\", which were approved in the following year. These standards governed the terms of the auditor's performance relating to professional conduct and the execution of the auditor's judgment during engagements.\n\n\n== Governance and oversight ==\n\nIn the United States, the SEC has generally deferred to the accounting industry (acting through various organizations throughout the years) as to the accounting standards for financial reporting, and the U.S. Congress has deferred to the SEC.\nThis is also typically the case in other developed economies.  In the UK, auditing guidelines are set by the institutes (including ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS and ICAI) of which auditing firms and individual auditors are members. While in Australia, the rules and professional code of ethics are set by The Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia (ICAA), CPA Australia (CPA) and The National Institute of Accountants (NIA).\nAccordingly, financial auditing standards and methods have tended to change significantly only after auditing failures.  The most recent and familiar case is that of Enron. The company succeeded in hiding some important facts, such as off-book liabilities, from banks and shareholders. Eventually, Enron filed for bankruptcy, and (as of 2006) is in the process of being dissolved.  One result of this scandal was that Arthur Andersen, then one of the five largest accountancy firms worldwide, lost their ability to audit public companies, essentially killing off the firm.\nA recent trend in audits (spurred on by such accounting scandals as Enron and Worldcom) has been an increased focus on internal control procedures, which aim to ensure the completeness, accuracy and validity of items in the accounts, and restricted access to financial systems.  This emphasis on the internal control environment is now a mandatory part of the audit of SEC-listed companies, under the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) set up by the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.\nMany countries have government sponsored or mandated organizations who develop and maintain auditing standards, commonly referred to generally accepted auditing standards or GAAS. These standards prescribe different aspects of auditing such as the opinion, stages of an audit, and controls over work product (i.e., working papers).\nSome oversight organizations require auditors and audit firms to undergo a third-party quality review periodically to ensure the applicable GAAS is followed.\n\n\n== Stages of an audit ==\nThe following are the stages of a typical audit:\n\n\n=== Phase I: planning of audit and design an audit approach ===\nAccept Client and Perform Initial Planning.\nUnderstand the Client's Business and Industry.\nWhat should auditors understand?\nThe relevant industry, regulatory, and other external factors including the applicable financial reporting framework\nThe nature of the entity\nThe entity's selection and application of accounting policies\nThe entity's objectives and strategies, and the related business risks that may result in material misstatement of the financial statements\nThe measurement and review of the entity's financial performance\nInternal control relevant to the audit\nAssess Client's Business Risk\nSet Materiality and Assess Accepted Audit Risk (AAR) and Inherent Risk (IR).\nUnderstand Internal Control and Assess Control Risk (CR).\nDevelop Overall Audit Plan and Audit Program\n\n\n=== Phase II: perform test of controls and substantive test of transactions ===\nTest of Control: if the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is the country where modern accounting practices developed in the late nineteenth century and where key regulatory and auditing standards evolved)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH INVESTORS<|>PERSON<|>British investors who brought accounting practices to the United States in the late nineteenth century)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH INVESTORS<|>PERSON<|>Scottish investors who brought accounting practices to the United States in the late nineteenth century)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTHUR YOUNG<|>PERSON<|>A chartered accountant from England who performed auditing work in the late 19th century in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWIN GUTHRIE<|>PERSON<|>A chartered accountant from England who performed auditing work in the late 19th century in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES T.
