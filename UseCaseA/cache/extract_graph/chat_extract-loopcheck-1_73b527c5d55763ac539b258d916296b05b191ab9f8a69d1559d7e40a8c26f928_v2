An internal audit checklist can be a helpful tool to identify common risks and desired controls in the specific process or specific industry being audited.\nDeveloping and executing a risk-based sampling and testing approach to determine whether the most important management controls are operating as intended.\nReporting issues and challenges identified and negotiating action plans with the management to address these problems.\nFollowing-up on reported findings at appropriate intervals. Internal audit departments maintain a follow-up database for this purpose.\nAudit assignment length varies based on the complexity of the activity being audited and internal audit resources available. Many of the above steps are iterative and may not all occur in the sequence indicated.\nIn addition to assessing business processes, specialists called information technology (IT) auditors review information technology controls.\n\n\n== Internal audit reports ==\nInternal auditors typically issue reports at the end of each audit that summarize their findings, recommendations, and any responses or action plans from management. An audit report may have an executive summary – a body that includes the specific issues or findings identified and related recommendations or action plans, and appendix information such as detailed graphs and charts or process information. Each audit finding within the body of the report may contain five elements, sometimes called the \"5 C's\":\n\nCondition: What is the particular problem identified?\nCriteria: What is the standard that was not met? The standard may be a company policy or other benchmark.\nCause: Why did the problem occur?\nConsequence: What is the risk/negative outcome (or opportunity foregone) because of the finding?\nCorrective action: What should management do about the finding? What have they agreed to do and by when?\nThe recommendations in an internal audit report are designed to help the organization achieve effective and  efficient governance, risk and control processes associated with operations objectives, financial and management reporting objectives; and legal/regulatory compliance objectives.\nAudit findings and recommendations may also relate to particular assertions about transactions, such as whether the transactions audited were valid or authorized, completely processed, accurately valued, processed in the correct time period, and properly disclosed in financial or operational reporting, among other elements. \nFollowing are the steps about how continuous improvement can be achieved through audit findings.\n\nDevelop CAPAs to address quality issues.\nTrain users or employees to develop effective audit processes or procedures.\nMaintain steady and healthy relation with suppliers, vendors, users, auditors and audit bodies.\nUnder the IIA standards, a critical component of the audit process is the preparation of a balanced report that provides executives and the board with the opportunity to evaluate and weigh the issues being reported in the proper context and perspective. In providing perspective, analysis and workable recommendations for business improvements in critical areas, auditors help the organization meet its objectives.\n\n\n=== Quality of internal audit report ===\nSource:\n\nObjectivity –  The comments and opinions expressed in the report should be objective and unbiased.\nClarity – The language used should be simple and straightforward.\nAccuracy – The information contained in the report should be accurate.\nBrevity – The report should be concise.\nTimeliness – The report should be released promptly immediately after the audit is concluded, within a month.\n\n\n== Strategy ==\nInternal audit functions may also develop functional strategies described in multi-year strategic plans.  Professional guidance on building an Internal Audit strategic plan was issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors in July 2012 via a Practice Guide called Developing the Internal Audit Strategic Plan.  A key aspect of developing IA strategy is understanding the expectations of stakeholders, such as the audit committee and top management. This helps guide the IA function in its mission of helping the organization address the risks it faces. Specific topics considered in IA strategic planning include:\n\nScope and emphasis: An IA function may be involved in addressing risks related to financial reporting, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, and the company strategy. There may also be special topics of interest to stakeholders that change considerably year-to-year.\nPortfolio of services: IA functions may provide traditional audit assurance across the risk spectrum as well as consulting project support in a variety of areas such as project management, data analysis, and monitoring of major company initiatives. Larger audit functions may establish specialty areas to handle their service portfolio.\nCompetency development: The stakeholder expectations around scope and service portfolio determine what competencies the function needs, which drives decisions regarding hiring of specific skills and training programs. The internal audit function is often used as a \"management training ground\" to provide employees with a deeper knowledge of the company's operations before they are rotated into a management position.\nTechnology: IA functions use a variety of technology tools/software to support audit process workflow, statistical analysis, and obtaining data from systems.\nBuilding the IA strategy may involve a variety of strategic management concepts and frameworks, such as strategic planning, strategic thinking, and SWOT analysis.\n\n\n== Other topics ==\n\n\n=== Measuring the internal audit function ===\nThe measurement of the internal audit function can involve a balanced scorecard approach. Internal audit functions are primarily evaluated based on the quality of counsel and information provided to the audit committee and top management.  However, this is primarily qualitative and therefore difficult to measure.  \"Customer surveys\" sent to key managers after each audit engagement or report can be used to measure performance, with an annual survey to the audit committee.  Scoring on dimensions such as professionalism, quality of counsel, timeliness of work product, utility of meetings, and quality of status updates are typical with such surveys. Understanding the expectations of senior management and the audit committee represent important steps in developing a performance measurement process, as well as how such measures help align the audit function with organizational priorities. \nIndependent peer reviews are part of the quality assurance process for many internal audit groups as they are often required by standards.
