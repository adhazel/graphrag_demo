Scoring on dimensions such as professionalism, quality of counsel, timeliness of work product, utility of meetings, and quality of status updates are typical with such surveys. Understanding the expectations of senior management and the audit committee represent important steps in developing a performance measurement process, as well as how such measures help align the audit function with organizational priorities. \nIndependent peer reviews are part of the quality assurance process for many internal audit groups as they are often required by standards. The resulting peer review report is made available to the audit committee.\n\n\n=== Reporting of critical findings ===\nThe chief audit executive (CAE) typically reports the most critical issues to the audit committee quarterly, along with management's progress towards resolving them.  Critical issues typically have a reasonable likelihood of causing substantial financial or reputational damage to the company.  For particularly complex issues, the responsible manager may participate in the discussion. Such reporting is critical to ensure the function is respected, that the proper \"tone at the top\" exists in the organization, and to expedite resolution of such issues.  It is a matter of considerable judgment to select appropriate issues for the audit committee's attention and to describe them in the proper context.\n\n\n=== Audit philosophy ===\nSome of the philosophy and approach of internal auditing is derived from the work of Lawrence Sawyer. His philosophy and guidance on the role of internal audit was a forerunner of the current definition of internal auditing. It emphasized assisting management and the board in achieving the organization's objectives through well-reasoned audits, evaluations, and analyses of operational areas. He encouraged the modern internal auditor to act as a counsellor to management rather than as an adversary. Sawyer saw auditors as active players influencing events in the business rather than criticizing all degrees of errors and mistakes. He also foresaw a more desirable auditor future involving a stronger relationship with members of audit committee and the board and a divorce from direct reporting to the chief financial officer.\nSawyer often talked about \"catching a manager doing something right\" and providing recognition and positive reinforcement. Writing about positive observations in audit reports was rarely done until Sawyer started talking about the idea. He understood and forecast the benefits of providing more balanced reporting while simultaneously building better relationships. Sawyer understood the psychology of interpersonal dynamics and the need for all people to receive acknowledgment and validation for relationships to prosper.\nSawyer helped make internal auditing more relevant and more interesting through a sharp focus on operational or performance auditing. He strongly encouraged looking beyond financial statements and financial-related auditing into areas such as purchasing, warehousing and distribution, human resources, information technology, facilities management, customer service, field operations, and program management. This approach helped catapult the chief audit executive into the role of a respected and knowledgeable adviser who was thought to be reasonable, objective, and concerned about helping the organization achieve the stated goals.\n\n\n=== Three lines of defence ===\nThe \"Three Lines of Defence Model\" \n\nis a framework outlining the relationship between business functions, risk management, and internal audit, delineating how responsibilities should be divided. It is designed \"to assure the effective and transparent management of risk\", by making accountabilities clear. The terminology is analogized from the military  \"Line of defence\" (and the concept of defence in depth).\n\nUnder the first line of defence, risks are managed and controlled day-to-day. Here customer-facing operational management has \"ownership, responsibility and accountability for directly assessing, controlling and mitigating risks\".  Its value  is that it comes \"from those who know the business, culture and day-to-day challenges\" (see also Internal control § Operating staff); at the same time, however, this Line may lack independence.\nThe second line of defence consists of the independent functions of Risk Management, Compliance, and Operational Risk. This line of defence monitors and facilitates the implementation of effective risk management practices by the first line, providing \"oversight and challenge\"; and also assists the \"risk owners\" in producing and interpreting risk-related reporting. Although separate from those responsible for delivery, it is not independent of the management chain. (See, re banking, Middle office.)\nThe third line of defence is internal audit, reporting directly to the Board of directors. Internal audit reviews and reports on both the first and the second lines of defence, providing objective and independent assurance,  per § Role in corporate governance above.\nUnder later iterations of the model, assurance from \"external independent bodies\"  is seen as a fourth line of defence; here the external auditor, and others, provide assurance and insights to the Board and are \"clearly seen to be independent\".\nThe \"last line of defence\"  against risk is that of capital, as a sufficient quantum \"ensures that a firm can continue as a going concern even if substantial and unexpected losses are incurred\"; see Risk capital, Regulatory capital, Financial risk management, and Going concern § Management's plans.\n\n\n=== Disruptive innovation ===\nInternal audit plays a critical role maintaining effective control mitigating emerging risks. Businesses will increase risk or bypass opportunity if auditors do not address disruption-related risks.  Michael G. Alles has discussed that Big Data is a disruptive innovation that auditors must  incorporate in practice. A 2019 study, Internal Auditors' Response to Disruptive Innovation, reports on the  evolution of internal audit to react to changes. Disruptions examined include data analytics, agile processes, cloud computing, robotic process automation, continuous auditing, regulatory change, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCertified Information Systems Auditor\nChartered Institute of Internal Auditors\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)\nFraud deterrence\nInstitute of Internal Auditors\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board\nIS audit\nOperational auditing\nRisk-based internal audit\n\n\n== References ==\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUDIT COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Audit Committee is a governance body that receives reports from the chief audit executive and oversees the internal audit function, ensuring alignment with organizational priorities and risk management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE<|>PERSON<|>The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) is the senior internal audit leader responsible for reporting critical audit issues to the audit committee and management, and for ensuring the internal audit function is respected and effective)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAWRENCE SAWYER<|>PERSON<|>Lawrence Sawyer was a pioneer in internal auditing philosophy, emphasizing the role of internal audit as a counselor to management and board, focusing on operational auditing and positive reinforcement in audit reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREE LINES OF DEFENCE MODEL<|>EVENT<|>The Three Lines of Defence Model is a risk management framework that delineates responsibilities among operational management, risk and compliance functions, and internal audit, to assure effective and transparent risk management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Board of Directors is the governing body to which internal audit reports directly, receiving assurance and oversight on risk management and control effectiveness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL G.
