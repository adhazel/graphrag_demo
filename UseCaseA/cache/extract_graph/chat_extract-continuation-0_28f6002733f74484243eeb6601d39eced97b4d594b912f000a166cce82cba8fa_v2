Fraud committed by owners and executives was more than nine times as costly as employee fraud. The industries most commonly affected are banking, manufacturing, and government.\n\n\n== By region ==\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n\n==== China ====\nIn China, according to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the Crime of Fraud (诈骗罪) refers to the \"criminal act of deceiving and obtaining public or private property\". According to Article 266 of the Criminal Law:\n\nThose who commit fraud involving a \"relatively large amount\" of public or private property shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, or injunction control with community correction, and may additionally or solely be fined.\nIf the amount involved is \"large\" or there are other serious circumstances, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years and shall also be fined.\nIf the amount involved is \"particularly large\" or there are other particularly serious circumstances, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of over ten years or life imprisonment and shall also be fined or have their property confiscated.\nAccording to the \"Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Specific Application of the Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Fraud\" (关于办理诈骗刑事案件具体应用法律若干问题的解释) issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate in 2011, for cases of fraud involving public or private property with a value ranging from 3,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, from 30,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, and over 500,000 yuan, they should be respectively deemed as \"relatively large amount\", \"large amount\", and \"particularly large amount\" as stipulated in Article 266 of the Criminal Law.\n\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, the criminal laws are enshrined in the Indian Penal Code, supplemented by the Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Evidence Act.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn 2016, the estimated value lost through fraud in the UK was £193 billion a year. In January 2018, the Financial Times reported that the value of UK fraud hit a 15-year high of £2.11bn in 2017, according to a study. The article said that the accountancy firm BDO examined reported fraud cases worth more than £50,000 and found that the total number rose to 577 in 2017, compared with 212 in 2003. The study found that the average amount stolen in each incident rose to £3.66m, up from £1.5m in 2003.\nAs at November 2017, fraud is the most common criminal offence in the UK according to a study by Crowe Clark Whitehill, Experian and the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies. The 2017 Annual Fraud Indicator shows that fraud costs about £10,000 per family in the UK, and the UK's fraud cost exceeds the gross domestic product of 148 countries such as Romania, Qatar and Hungary.\nAccording to another review by the UK anti-fraud charity Fraud Advisory Panel (FAP), business fraud accounted for £144bn, while fraud against individuals was estimated at £9.7bn. The FAP has been particularly critical of the support available from the police to victims of fraud in the UK outside of London. Although victims of fraud are generally referred to the UK's national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre, Action Fraud, the FAP found that there was \"little chance\" that these crime reports would be followed up with any kind of substantive law enforcement action by UK authorities, according to the report.\nIn July 2016, it was reported that fraudulent activity levels in the UK increased in the 10 years leading up to 2016 from £52 billion to £193 bn. This figure would be a conservative estimate, since as the former commissioner of the City of London Police, Adrian Leppard, has said, only 1 in 12 such crimes are actually reported. Donald Toon, director of the NCA's economic crime command, stated in July 2016: \"The annual losses to the UK from fraud are estimated to be more than £190bn\". Figures released in October 2015 from the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that there had been 5.1 million incidents of fraud in England and Wales in the previous year, affecting an estimated one in 12 adults and making it the most common form of crime.\nAlso in July 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) stated: \"Almost six million fraud and cyber crimes were committed last year in England and Wales and estimated there were two million computer misuse offences and 3.8 million fraud offences in the 12 months to the end of March 2016.\" Fraud affects one in ten people in the UK. According to the ONS, most fraud relates to bank account fraud. These figures are separate from the headline estimate that another 6.3 million crimes (distinct from fraud) were perpetrated in the UK against adults in the year to March 2016.\nFraud was not included in a \"Crime Harm Index\" published by the Office for National Statistics in 2016.  The Chief of the National Audit Office (NAO), Sir Anyas Morse has also said \"For too long, as a low-value but high-volume crime, online fraud has been overlooked by government, law enforcement and industry. It is now the most commonly experienced crime in England and Wales and demands an urgent response.\"\nHM Treasury issued guidance\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners is an organization that conducts surveys and research on fraud, estimating typical organizational losses due to fraud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country in Asia with specific laws regarding fraud, as outlined in the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Supreme People's Court in China issues interpretations on legal matters, including fraud cases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPREME PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Supreme People's Procuratorate in China collaborates with the Supreme People's Court on legal interpretations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country in Asia with criminal laws related to fraud, as outlined in the Indian Penal Code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is a country in Europe with significant issues related to fraud, as reported in various studies and reports)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Financial Times is a publication that reported on the high value of fraud in the UK in 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BDO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BDO is an accountancy firm that conducted a study on fraud cases in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWE CLARK WHITEHILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crowe Clark Whitehill is an organization involved in a study on fraud in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Experian is a company that participated in a study on fraud in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRE FOR COUNTER FRAUD STUDIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Centre for Counter Fraud Studies is involved in research on fraud in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRAUD ADVISORY PANEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fraud Advisory Panel is a UK anti-fraud charity that reviews and reports on fraud issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTION FRAUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Action Fraud is the UK's national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF LONDON POLICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City of London Police is involved in addressing fraud in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADRIAN LEPPARD<|>PERSON<|>Adrian Leppard is the former commissioner of the City of London Police, who commented on fraud reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TOON<|>PERSON<|>Donald Toon is the director of the NCA's economic crime command, who commented on fraud losses in the UK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Office for National Statistics in the UK provides data on fraud and cybercrime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Audit Office in the UK addresses issues related to online fraud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIR ANYAS MORSE<|>PERSON<|>Sir Anyas Morse is the Chief of the National Audit Office, who commented on online fraud)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT<|>SUPREME PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE<|>The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate in China collaborate on legal interpretations regarding fraud<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL TIMES<|>BDO<|>The Financial Times reported on a study conducted by BDO regarding fraud in the UK<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWE CLARK WHITEHILL<|>EXPERIAN<|>Crowe Clark Whitehill and Experian collaborated on a study about fraud in the UK<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWE CLARK WHITEHILL<|>CENTRE FOR COUNTER FRAUD STUDIES<|>Crowe Clark Whitehill and the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies collaborated on a study about fraud in the UK<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPERIAN<|>CENTRE FOR COUNTER FRAUD STUDIES<|>Experian and the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies collaborated on a study about fraud in the UK<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRAUD ADVISORY PANEL<|>ACTION FRAUD<|>The Fraud Advisory Panel reviewed the effectiveness of Action Fraud in addressing fraud reports in the UK<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADRIAN LEPPARD<|>CITY OF LONDON POLICE<|>Adrian Leppard, as the former commissioner of the City of London Police, commented on fraud reporting<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TOON<|>NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY<|>Donald Toon is the director of the NCA's economic crime command, which addresses fraud in the UK<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIR ANYAS MORSE<|>NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE<|>Sir Anyas Morse, as the Chief of the National Audit Office, commented on online fraud<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
