For example, in 2005, several managers of the service provider Aramark were found to be under-reporting profits from a string of vending machine locations in the eastern United States. While the amount stolen from each machine was relatively small, the total amount taken from many machines over a length of time was very large. A technique employed by many small-time embezzlers can be covered by falsifying the records. (For example, by removing a small amount of money and falsifying the record the register would be consistent, while the manager would remove the profit and leave the float in; this method would effectively make the register short for the next user and throw the blame onto them.)\nAnother method is to create a false vendor account and supply false bills to the company being embezzled so that the checks that are cut appear completely legitimate. Yet another method is to create phantom employees, who are then paid with payroll checks.\nThe latter two methods should be uncovered by routine audits, but often are not if the audit is not sufficiently in-depth, because the paperwork appears to be in order. A publicly traded company must change auditors and audit companies every five years. The first method is easier to detect if all transactions are by cheque or other instrument, but if many transactions are in cash, it is much more difficult to identify. Employers have developed a number of strategies to deal with this problem. In fact, cash registers were invented just for this reason.\nSome of the most complex (and potentially most lucrative) forms of embezzlement involve Ponzi-like financial schemes where high returns to early investors are paid out of funds received from later investors duped into believing they are themselves receiving entry into a high-return investment scheme. The Madoff investment scandal is an example of this kind of high-level embezzlement scheme, where it is alleged that $65 billion was siphoned off from gullible investors and financial institutions.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nInternal controls such as separation of duties are common defences against embezzlement. For example, at a movie theatre (cinema), the task of accepting money and admitting customers into the theatre is typically broken up into two jobs. One employee sells the ticket, and another employee takes the ticket and lets the customer into the theatre. Because a ticket cannot be printed without entering the sale into the computer (or, in earlier times, without using up a serial-numbered printed ticket), and the customer cannot enter the theatre without a ticket, both of these employees would have to collude in order for embezzlement to go undetected. This significantly reduces the chance of theft, because of the added difficulty in arranging such a conspiracy and the likely need to split the proceeds between the two employees, which reduces the payoff for each.\nAnother obvious method to deter embezzlement is to regularly and unexpectedly move funds from one advisor or entrusted person to another when the funds are supposed to be available for withdrawal or use, to ensure that the full amount of the funds is available and no fraction of the savings has been embezzled by the person to whom the funds or savings have been entrusted.\n\n\n== Worldwide ==\nIn 2020, 37% of employee fraud happened because of a lack of internal controls or lack of independent checks and audits, 18% by overriding internal controls, 18% from lack of management review, 10% from a poor tone set by top managers, and 17% from other causes.\n\n\n=== England and Wales ===\nOffences of embezzlement were formerly created by sections 18 and 19 of the Larceny Act 1916.\nThe former offences of embezzlement are replaced by the new offence of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, embezzlement is a statutory offence that, depending on the circumstances, may be a crime under state law, federal law, or both, with the definition of the crime of embezzlement varying according to the statutes of the jurisdiction in which charges are filed. Typical elements of the crime of embezzlement are the fraudulent conversion of the property of another person by the person who has lawful possession of the property.\n\nIn 2005–2009 the United States had 18,000 to 22,000 arrests for embezzlement per year, and 13,500 arrests in 2019. A 2009 journal article reported estimates that three quarters of medical professionals would suffer from embezzlement at least once in their career.\nIn 2018 the average embezzlement stole $360,000. The estimated losses in 2005–2009 (including the many with no arrest) were $400 billion per year. In 2018 companies brought charges in 45% of cases.\n85% of incidents involved an embezzler who was a manager or higher. The average incident involved three embezzlers, and 79% of incidents involved more than one embezzler. 70% of cases went undetected for over a year, and 31% lasted over three years. The average embezzler had worked at the company for eight years. 39% of financial professionals who experienced embezzlements had experienced a prior incident of it. After the embezzlement, 26% of the companies affected increased their security and audit requirements, 27% increased spending on audits, and 29% reviewed their anti-fraud controls frequently. However 97% of companies which had experienced embezzlement were \"confident the anti-fraud controls in place ... would prevent future embezzlement\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARAMARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aramark is a service provider operating vending machine locations in the eastern United States, involved in a 2005 incident where several managers were found to be under-reporting profits and embezzling funds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where embezzlement is a statutory offence under state and federal law, with significant arrest and loss statistics reported between 2005 and 2019)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADOFF INVESTMENT SCANDAL<|>EVENT<|>The Madoff investment scandal is a high-level embezzlement case involving a Ponzi-like scheme where approximately $65 billion was siphoned from investors and financial institutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARCENY ACT 1916<|>EVENT<|>The Larceny Act 1916 was a former legal statute in England and Wales that created offences of embezzlement, later replaced by the Theft Act 1968)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEFT ACT 1968<|>EVENT<|>The Theft Act 1968 is a legal statute in England and Wales that replaced former embezzlement offences with the new offence of theft under section 1)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND AND WALES<|>GEO<|>England and Wales is a jurisdiction where embezzlement offences were governed by the Larceny Act 1916 and later the Theft Act 1968)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE FRAUD 2020<|>EVENT<|>A 2020 worldwide report on employee fraud indicating causes such as lack of internal controls, overriding controls, poor management review, and other factors contributing to embezzlement)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARAMARK<|>UNITED STATES<|>Aramark operates vending machine locations in the eastern United States where embezzlement by managers was detected in 2005<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADOFF INVESTMENT SCANDAL<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Madoff investment scandal occurred in the United States involving large-scale embezzlement<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARCENY ACT 1916<|>ENGLAND AND WALES<|>The Larceny Act 1916 was a legal statute in England and Wales that created offences of embezzlement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEFT ACT 1968<|>ENGLAND AND WALES<|>The Theft Act 1968 replaced the Larceny Act 1916 in England and Wales, changing the legal treatment of embezzlement offences<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEE FRAUD 2020<|>UNITED STATES<|>The 2020 worldwide employee fraud report includes data relevant to embezzlement in the United States<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
