If internal controls are assessed as effective, this will reduce (but not eliminate) the amount of 'substantive' work the auditor needs to do (see below).\nSubstantive test of transactions: evaluate the client's recording of transactions by verifying the monetary amounts of transactions, a process called substantive tests of transactions. For example, the auditor might use computer software to compare the unit selling price on duplicate sales invoices with an electronic file of approved prices as a test of the accuracy objective for sales transactions. Like the test of control in the preceding paragraph, this test satisfies the accuracy transaction-related audit objective for sales. For the sake of efficiency, auditors often perform tests of controls and substantive tests of transactions at the same time.\nAssess Likelihood of Misstatement in Financial Statement.\nNotes:\n\nAt this stage, if the auditor accept the CR that has been set at the phase I and does not want to reduce the controls risk, then the auditor may not perform test of control. If so, then the auditor perform substantive test of transactions.\nThis test determines the amount of work to be performed i.e. substantive testing or test of details.\n\n\n=== Phase III: perform analytical procedures and tests of details of balances ===\nwhere internal controls are strong, auditors typically rely more on Substantive Analytical Procedures (the comparison of sets of financial information, and financial with non-financial information, to see if the numbers 'make sense' and that unexpected movements can be explained)\nwhere internal controls are weak, auditors typically rely more on Substantive Tests of Detail of Balance (selecting a sample of items from the major account balances, and finding hard evidence (e.g. invoices, bank statements) for those items)\nNotes:\n\nSome audits involve a 'hard close' or 'fast close' whereby certain substantive procedures can be performed before year-end.  For example, if the year-end is 31 December, the hard close may provide the auditors with figures as at 30 November.  The auditors would audit income/expense movements between 1 January and 30 November, so that after year end, it is only necessary for them to audit the December income/expense movements and 31 December balance sheet.  In some countries and accountancy firms these are known as 'rollforward' procedures.\n\n\n=== Phase IV: complete the audit and issue an audit report ===\nAfter the auditor has completed all procedures for each audit objective and for each financial statement account and related disclosures, it is necessary to combine the information obtained to reach an overall conclusion as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. This highly subjective process relies heavily on the auditor's professional judgment. When the audit is completed, the CPA must issue an audit report to accompany the client's published financial statements.\n\n\n== Responsibilities of an auditor ==\nCorporations Act 2001 requires the auditor to:\n\nGive a true and fair view about whether the financial report complies with the accounting standards\nConduct their audit in accordance with auditing standards\nGive the directors and auditor's independence declaration and meet independence requirements\nReport certain suspected contraventions to ASIC\n\n\n== Commercial relationships versus objectivity ==\nOne of the major issues faced by private auditing firms is the need to provide independent auditing services while maintaining a business relationship with the audited company.\nThe auditing firm's responsibility to check and confirm the reliability of financial statements may be limited by pressure from the audited company, who pays the auditing firm for the service.  The auditing firm's need to maintain a viable business through auditing revenue may be weighed against its duty to examine and verify the accuracy, relevancy, and completeness of the company's financial statements. This is done by auditor.\nNumerous proposals are made to revise the current system to provide better economic incentives to auditors to perform the auditing function without having their commercial interests compromised by client relationships.  Examples are more direct incentive compensation awards and financial statement insurance approaches. See, respectively, Incentive Systems to Promote Capital Market Gatekeeper Effectiveness and Financial Statement Insurance.\n\n\n== Related qualifications ==\nThere are several related professional qualifications in the field of financial audit including Certified Internal Auditor, Certified General Accountant, Chartered Certified Accountant, Chartered Accountant and Certified Public Accountant.\n\n\n== Auditors and technology ==\nCurrently, many entities being audited are using information systems, which generate information electronically. For the audit evidences, auditors get dynamic information generated from the information systems in real time. There are less paper documents and pre-numbered audit evidences available, which leads a revolution to audit mythology.\n\n\n=== Impact of information technology on the audit process ===\nOver the past couple of years, technology is becoming a bigger emphasis for the audit profession, professional bodies, and regulators. From operational efficiency to financial inclusion and increased insights, technology has a lot to offer. The way businesses are performed and data is analyzed is changing as a result of technological advancements. Data management is becoming increasingly important. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics are major changers in the accounting and auditing industries, altering auditors' roles. The introduction of cloud computing and cloud storage has opened up previously unimaginable possibilities for data collection and analysis. Auditors can now acquire and analyze broader industry data\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
