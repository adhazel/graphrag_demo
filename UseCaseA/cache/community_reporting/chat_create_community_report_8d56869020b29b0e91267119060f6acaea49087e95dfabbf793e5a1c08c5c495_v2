Money laundering is connected to various criminal sources such as drug trafficking, sex work, terrorism, corruption, tax evasion, and false accounting, which generate illicit funds that are disguised through complex financial transactions. Governments and international regulators play a critical role in combating money laundering by implementing laws and surveillance systems. Financial institutions, including banks and cash-intensive businesses, are key actors in both facilitating and preventing money laundering. Emerging technologies such as digital assets and cryptocurrencies have introduced new challenges, with cybercriminals exploiting these for laundering purposes.

It involves converting these illicit funds into seemingly legitimate sources to evade taxes, pay bribes, and conceal the true nature of financial transactions. The process typically occurs in three stages: placement, layering, and integration, often using front organizations and complex financial mechanisms to obscure the money’s origin. This central role of money laundering in facilitating criminal enterprises makes it a significant policy concern worldwide due to its impact on the integrity of financial systems and its facilitation of further criminal activities [Data: Entities (319); Relationships (366, 341, 352, 353, 354, 355, 362, 363, 364, 365, 367, 391, 395, 399, 400, 401, 485, 497, 498)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Governments and International Regulators as Key Anti-Money Laundering Actors\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Governments are national authorities responsible for regulating and administering laws to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

These entities are crucial in maintaining legal and financial order, and governments can face sanctions if they fail to comply with international legal frameworks.
