The section establishes fraud as a criminal offence that can be prosecuted either as an indictable offence or a summary conviction offence, depending on the severity and nature of the act.

It outlines the conditions under which fraud is established, including the necessary elements and penalties. This section serves as the legal basis for prosecuting fraud offences in Canada, making it a critical entity in understanding fraud-related legal matters.

Indictable offences are more serious, carrying penalties of imprisonment up to fourteen years, reflecting the gravity of high-value or egregious fraud cases. Summary conviction offences are less serious, with penalties including imprisonment up to two years or other sanctions, typically applied to lower-value frauds.
