Their work involves assessing risks, testing controls, and collecting audit evidence to support their conclusions. This central role is underscored by their engagement with various audit procedures such as substantive analytical procedures and substantive tests of detail of balances, which help identify anomalies and verify account balances. The auditor's function is critical in maintaining trust and accountability in financial reporting, as they ensure compliance with established standards like ISA and US GAAP [Data: Entities (7); Relationships (5, 166, 167, 186, 188, +more)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"ASIC's regulatory oversight and legal compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) serves as the regulatory authority overseeing auditors' activities, particularly requiring auditors to report any suspected contraventions.

These certifications represent specialized knowledge and adherence to ethical and professional standards in auditing and accounting. For example, the Certified Public Accountant credential, established in the United States in 1896, licenses auditors and signifies their competence in accounting principles and auditing standards.
