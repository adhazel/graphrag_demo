Arthur Andersen's failure to properly audit and report Enron's financial misstatements, including the destruction of relevant documents, led to its loss of ability to audit public companies and effectively ended its operations.

SOX aims to restore investor confidence by mandating reforms such as independent audits of internal controls over financial reporting and enhancing corporate transparency. The Act applies primarily to public companies, requiring them to implement and maintain effective internal controls and undergo independent audits to deter fraud.

Following these scandals, internal control procedures became a mandatory focus in audits to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and validity of financial accounts. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act further institutionalized the requirement for robust internal controls in public companies, aiming to reduce the opportunity for fraud as described in the Fraud Triangle framework.

These failures prompted reforms aimed at increasing the independence and rigor of audits, as well as enhancing the accountability of auditors.
