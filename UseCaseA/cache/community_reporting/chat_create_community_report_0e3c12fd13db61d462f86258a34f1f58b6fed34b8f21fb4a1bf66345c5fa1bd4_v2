Enacted in 2006 and effective from January 2007, it replaced previous deception laws under the Theft Act 1978, providing clearer statutory definitions and penalties for fraud offences. The Act outlines three main classes of fraud: fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose information, and fraud by abuse of position. Legal processes under the Act include summary conviction, with penalties up to six months imprisonment or fines, and conviction on indictment, which can result in up to ten years imprisonment or fines.
