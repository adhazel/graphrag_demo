Round-tripping is a primary technique where illicit funds are cycled through offshore banks and disguised via law firms to evade taxation. Offshore banks and tax havens provide critical financial secrecy and regulatory leniency, facilitating the concealment and legalization of dirty money.

This method obscures the origin of funds by cycling them through multiple jurisdictions and entities, making detection and enforcement challenging. Variants of round-tripping include the use of law firms to disguise illicit funds as legal fees or litigation proceeds, adding a layer of legitimacy to the transactions.
