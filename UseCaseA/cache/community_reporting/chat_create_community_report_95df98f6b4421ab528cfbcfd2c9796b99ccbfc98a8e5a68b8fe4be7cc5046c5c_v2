The country also codified internal auditing professional standards through the Institute of Internal Auditors, with several states enshrining these standards into law. Publicly traded companies in the United States are legally required to have internal auditors who report functionally to the board of directors, ensuring robust oversight and transparency.\n\nThe United States has enacted a range of civil fraud laws and anti-fraud provisions that vary by state, with criminal fraud charges classified as misdemeanors or felonies depending on the amount of loss involved. Embezzlement is recognized as a statutory offense under both state and federal law, with significant arrest and loss statistics reported between 2005 and 2019, reflecting the country’s active enforcement against financial crimes.\n\nMoney laundering is specifically defined under U.S. law as financial transactions intended to conceal the identity, source, or destination of illegally obtained money. The country has been the site of numerous high-profile money laundering cases and investigations, including those involving major entities such as BNP Paribas and the FBI. Notable legal actions include the shutdown of Liberty Reserve and cases addressing reverse money laundering. To enhance transparency and combat illicit financial activities, the United States enacted the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which requires the disclosure of beneficial owners of companies.\n\nOverall, the United States combines a long history of accounting and auditing innovation with a strong and evolving legal framework aimed at preventing and prosecuting financial crimes, thereby maintaining the integrity of its financial system.\",41\r\n293,HIGH-VALUE FRAUD,\"Fraud involving large sums of money, which in the United States can trigger enhanced penalties, such as in California where losses over $500,000 increase prison terms\",2\r\n724,SARBANES–OXLEY ACT OF 2002,A United States federal law enacted in 2002 that enhanced the exposure and value of the internal auditing profession by requiring companies to meet stricter financial policy and procedural requirements,2\r\n101,BRITISH INVESTORS,\"British investors played a significant role in shaping accounting and auditing practices in the United States during the late 19th century.
