It involves converting these illicit funds into seemingly legitimate sources to evade taxes, pay bribes, and conceal the true nature of the financial transactions. This process poses significant policy concerns worldwide due to its impact on the integrity of financial systems and its facilitation of criminal activities. Money laundering typically occurs through three main stages: placement, where the illicit funds are introduced into the financial system; layering, which involves complex transactions to obscure the money’s origin; and integration, where the laundered money is reintroduced into the economy as apparently legitimate assets.
