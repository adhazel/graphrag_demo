The key entities include various types of audit opinions—Unqualified, Qualified, Disclaimer, and Adverse—each representing different levels of assurance and findings regarding the fairness of financial statements. These opinions are all linked to the Financial Audit process and are grounded in International Accounting Standards, which serve as the criteria for assessing financial reporting.

It encapsulates the auditor's judgment on whether the financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. This opinion directly results from the Financial Audit process, linking the audit procedures to the communicated outcome.

Each type conveys a different level of assurance and implication about the financial statements. An Unqualified Auditor's Opinion indicates that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects, representing the highest level of assurance. A Qualified Opinion signals that, except for certain material misstatements, the statements are fairly presented. A Disclaimer indicates that the auditor is unable to express an opinion due to insufficient evidence or lack of independence. An Adverse Audit Opinion is issued when financial statements do not present fairly due to significant departures from accounting standards. This classification system allows users to understand the reliability and limitations of the financial information presented [Data: Entities (12, 13, 14, 15); Relationships (10, 11, 12, 13)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Audit opinions are grounded in International Accounting Standards\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The issuance of audit opinions is based on whether financial statements comply with International Accounting Standards (IAS) or other applicable criteria. These standards provide a globally recognized framework for preparing and presenting financial information, ensuring consistency and comparability across entities and jurisdictions. The adherence to IAS is critical for auditors to form their opinions and for users to trust the financial reports.

This situation arises when auditors cannot obtain adequate information to form a basis for an opinion, or when conflicts of interest impair auditor objectivity. The disclaimer signals a high level of uncertainty and risk, as stakeholders cannot rely on the financial statements' accuracy or completeness.
