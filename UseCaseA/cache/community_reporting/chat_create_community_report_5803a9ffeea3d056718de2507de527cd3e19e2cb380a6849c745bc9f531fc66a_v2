Key entities include offshore banks, which facilitate the movement of funds offshore and back, and law firms, which are used in variants of round-tripping to disguise illicit funds as legal fees or litigation proceeds.

This method allows entities to evade taxation by masking the true origin of the funds. Variants of this method include the use of law firms to further obscure the illicit nature of the money by presenting it as legal fees or litigation proceeds.
