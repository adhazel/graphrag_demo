The key entities include the Master, who held property rights over the labor and goods produced by slaves, and the Slave, who was legally bound to provide labor under conditions of servitude.

This statute provided a formal legal basis for the master's ownership and control, effectively sanctioning the exploitation of labor under conditions of servitude. By embedding these rights in law, the statute reinforced the social and economic hierarchy that placed masters in positions of power over slaves and indentured servants.

The master's property rights extended not only to the labor itself but also to the goods produced by that labor. This dual ownership underscores the comprehensive control masters had over both the workforce and the economic outputs generated by them.

This legal status deprived slaves of personal autonomy and subjected them to forced labor.
