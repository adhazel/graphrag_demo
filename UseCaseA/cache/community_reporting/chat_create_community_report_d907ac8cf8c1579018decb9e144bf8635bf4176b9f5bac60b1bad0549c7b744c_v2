Their primary role is to provide independent and objective assurance and consulting services that help organizations identify weaknesses, ensure compliance, and enhance overall operational efficiency. Unlike external auditors who primarily attest to financial reports, internal auditors focus on assessing the presence and effectiveness of management control components, corporate governance, and risk management frameworks within the organization.\n\nInternal auditors perform comprehensive audits, issue detailed reports summarizing their findings, recommendations, and management responses, and work collaboratively with organizational leadership to implement improvements.
