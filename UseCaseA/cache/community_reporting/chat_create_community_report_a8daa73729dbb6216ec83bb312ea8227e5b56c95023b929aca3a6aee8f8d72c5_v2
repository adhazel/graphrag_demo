The Institute provided key auditing guidance to U.S. federal agencies such as the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission in 1917, including the issuance of a Technical Memorandum outlining recommended auditing procedures and financial statement formats. The community also includes the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), which evolved from the Institute's advocacy starting in 1947, and related auditing procedures and financial statements such as the Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet. These entities are interconnected through their shared focus on establishing and maintaining auditing quality, compliance, and financial reporting standards.
