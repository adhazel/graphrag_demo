This technique leverages the inherent subjectivity in valuing goods, particularly in the art market, where artwork values can be highly subjective and auction house secrecy further complicates transparency. The complexity of this laundering method makes detection and enforcement challenging for authorities, allowing illicit funds to be integrated into the legitimate financial system with relative ease.
