Beginning in 1932, the NYSE mandated financial audits for listed companies, which marked a significant shift towards formalizing and standardizing auditing practices in the United States. This requirement helped to ensure greater transparency and reliability in financial reporting, thereby enhancing investor protection and market integrity.
