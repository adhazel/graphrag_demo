This susceptibility arises from the subjective nature of artwork valuations, which can be manipulated to disguise illicit financial flows. The lack of transparency in pricing and provenance makes it difficult to trace the true value and ownership of artworks, thereby providing opportunities for laundering money through art transactions.

These organizations often maintain strict confidentiality regarding the identities of buyers and sellers, which can be exploited to conceal illicit activities. The secrecy upheld by auction houses creates a veil that can obscure the origin and destination of funds, making it challenging for authorities to detect and prevent money laundering.

This confidentiality prevents transparency and accountability, allowing illicit actors to use art transactions as a means to legitimize illegal funds. The subjective valuation of artworks further complicates detection efforts, as prices can be artificially inflated or deflated to suit laundering objectives.
