This absence of regulatory oversight makes it an attractive medium for criminals to launder money obtained from various illegal activities. Specifically, ransomware attackers, cyber fraudsters, and gunrunners utilize Bitcoin to convert illicit proceeds into seemingly legitimate funds. The high degree of Bitcoin (8) and its multiple direct relationships with criminal actors underscore its pivotal role in this ecosystem [Data: Entities (407, 429, 431, 432); Relationships (442, 443, 444)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Tor's role in obfuscating Bitcoin transactions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Tor is a critical technical enabler within this community, providing anonymity by obfuscating the origins of Bitcoin transactions. This capability allows users to circumvent national laws and regulatory scrutiny, thereby facilitating the laundering of illicit funds. The relationship between Bitcoin and Tor is strong, with a combined degree of 9, indicating frequent and significant use of Tor services to hide transaction trails.
