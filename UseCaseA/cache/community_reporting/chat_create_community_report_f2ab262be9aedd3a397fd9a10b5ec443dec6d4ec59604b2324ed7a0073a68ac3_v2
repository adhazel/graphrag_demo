Accounting firms conduct financial audits to detect material misstatements in financial statements, which are critical errors or omissions that can influence economic decisions. Regulators and tax authorities rely on these audits to enforce compliance and ensure accurate tax reporting, while customers use audited financial statements to assess company viability. The community also includes foundational standards like ISA 450 that define material misstatements, and concepts such as information asymmetry and information risk that audits aim to mitigate.

These firms employ external auditors who independently assess financial reports to detect errors or omissions that could mislead stakeholders. The centrality of accounting firms is underscored by their direct relationship with financial audits, positioning them as key facilitators of transparency and accountability in financial reporting.
