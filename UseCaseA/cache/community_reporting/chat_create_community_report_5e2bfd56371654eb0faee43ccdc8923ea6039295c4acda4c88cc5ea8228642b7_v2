The Act replaced the Theft Act 1978 in regulating fraud-related crimes and establishes three main classes of fraud offences: fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose information, and fraud by abuse of position. The Act also outlines legal processes for prosecution, including summary conviction and conviction on indictment, with varying penalties.

Enacted in 2006 and effective from January 2007, it replaced previous deception laws under the Theft Act 1978, providing clearer statutory definitions and penalties for fraud-related crimes. This Act establishes the legal basis for prosecuting fraud in these jurisdictions, reflecting a modernization of fraud law to address contemporary challenges.

Instead, fraud offences in Scotland are governed by common law and separate statutory provisions. This separation means that while England, Wales, and Northern Ireland operate under the Fraud Act 2006 framework, Scotland maintains a distinct legal approach to fraud.

Fraud by failing to disclose information occurs when there is a legal duty to disclose certain facts but the individual intentionally withholds them. Fraud by abuse of position involves exploiting a position of trust to commit fraud.
