Their role is pivotal in ensuring that audits are performed according to professional standards and regulatory requirements. The degree of connectivity (degree 6) indicates that CPA firms are highly influential within this community, acting as the nexus between audit fees and audit quality considerations.

These fees are influenced by multiple factors, including the nature of the entity being audited, the complexity and volume of transactions, the industry sector, and the condition of the financial records. The relationship between CPA firms and audit fees is strong (combined degree 9), underscoring that fee setting is a critical commercial decision that must balance cost recovery with professional obligations.
