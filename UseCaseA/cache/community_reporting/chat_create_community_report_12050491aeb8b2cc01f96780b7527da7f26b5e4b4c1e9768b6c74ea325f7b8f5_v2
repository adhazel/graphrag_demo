The Supreme Court of Canada plays a pivotal role in interpreting these laws, including the concept of deprivation in fraud cases. Canadian courts have the authority to issue specific orders related to fraud convictions, such as prohibition orders under Section 380.2 and restitution orders under Section 380.3, which respectively restrict offenders from holding positions of authority over others' property and mandate compensation to victims.

It is the country that enacts and enforces the Criminal Code, including provisions related to fraud. The significance of Canada in this community is underscored by its role in defining the legal boundaries and consequences of fraudulent activities, which affects all entities and individuals subject to its laws.

These orders serve as a preventative measure to reduce the risk of further fraudulent activities by restricting offenders' access to sensitive roles.
