In line with its commitment to combat financial crime, Australia established the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) system in 2006, which mandates the electronic reporting of all financial transactions to detect and prevent money laundering activities. Furthermore, Australia is actively planning to strengthen its anti-money laundering laws to address emerging challenges, particularly the potential misuse of decentralized digital currencies such as Bitcoin for criminal and corrupt purposes.
