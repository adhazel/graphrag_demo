This legislation was enacted to enhance the reliability and accuracy of corporate disclosures and to protect investors from fraudulent accounting activities. One of the key provisions of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act was the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which plays a crucial role in overseeing the audits of public companies to ensure that they are conducted with integrity and transparency.\n\nThe Act placed a strong emphasis on internal control procedures, mandating that companies implement robust systems to manage and report financial data accurately.
