In addition to its legislative duties, the U.S. Congress has historically deferred to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the establishment and oversight of accounting standards for financial reporting. This delegation reflects Congress's recognition of the SEC's expertise in regulating financial disclosures to ensure transparency and protect investors.
