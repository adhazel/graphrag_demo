These standards are designed to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world by providing a common language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. The IFRS are widely adopted by companies and are recognized for their role in enhancing the quality and consistency of financial reporting globally. The IASB, as the authoritative body, ensures that these standards are developed through a comprehensive and inclusive process, involving consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including investors, analysts, regulators, business leaders, and the accountancy profession.
