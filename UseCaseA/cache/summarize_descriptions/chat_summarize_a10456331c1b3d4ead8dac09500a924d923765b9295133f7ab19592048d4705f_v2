Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, played a pivotal role in reforming the American financial system during his time in office.

Roosevelt also enacted significant legislation, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which laid the foundation for modern securities regulation. These measures were designed to restore investor confidence following the stock market crash of 1929 and to protect the public from fraudulent practices in the securities industry.
