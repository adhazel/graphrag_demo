IFRS specify how particular types of transactions and other financial events should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in financial statements. These standards require companies to report current and non-current assets and liabilities separately, ensuring clarity and comparability in financial position reporting. Additionally, IFRS provide specific guidance on the format and presentation of financial statements in hyperinflationary economies, addressing the unique challenges posed by such economic environments.
