Their primary role involves conducting financial audits to ensure compliance with accounting standards and to identify any irregularities or fraudulent activities, such as embezzlement. Unlike forensic accountants, who specialize in investigating criminal financial offenses, auditors focus on verifying the integrity of financial data and reporting. In publicly traded companies, auditors are subject to mandatory rotation every five years to maintain independence and objectivity. The role of auditors is continuously evolving due to technological advancements, including the integration of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics, which enhance their ability to analyze complex financial data and improve audit quality.
