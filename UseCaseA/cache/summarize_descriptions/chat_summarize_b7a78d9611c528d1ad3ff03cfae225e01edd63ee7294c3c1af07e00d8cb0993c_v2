In the late 19th century, Scottish investors had a notable influence on American accounting practices, contributing to the development and evolution of financial systems in the United States. This historical impact highlights Scotland's longstanding engagement with international finance and its contribution to global economic practices.\n\nWithin its own legal framework, Scotland addresses fraud through a combination of common law and statutory offences. Unlike other parts of the United Kingdom, Scotland does not rely on the Fraud Act 2006 to prosecute fraudulent activities. Instead, it utilizes its own legal traditions and statutes to manage and adjudicate cases of fraud, reflecting its unique legal system and approach to criminal justice. This distinct legal framework underscores Scotland's autonomy in certain legal matters, even as it remains an integral part of the United Kingdom.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1746703690, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
