In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to charges of falsifying business records and conspiracy for violating U.S. sanctions against countries including Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. As a result of these violations, the bank was subjected to one of the largest fines ever imposed on a financial institution, paying an $8.9 billion penalty. This fine, announced in July 2014 by the U.S. government, was related to breaches of money laundering regulations connected to the bankâ€™s processing of transactions involving sanctioned countries.
