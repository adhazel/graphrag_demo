Additionally, the Audit Committee approves key elements related to the internal audit function, including the internal audit charter, audit plans, and budgets, and makes decisions regarding the appointment and performance of the chief audit executive. Beyond internal audit oversight, the committee also sets audit fees, monitors audit quality, and coordinates efforts between internal auditors, external auditors, and management to address management control issues effectively.
