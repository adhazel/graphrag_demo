## Why GraphRAG
While traditional RAG (the top "N" search pattern) allows for easy access to information, GraphRAG may offer additional capability with dealing challenging topics or complex information spaces.

The table below provides a quick comparison for reference. The key takeaway is that many Generative AI topics involve a tradeoff between cost and speed versus scale and depth of reasoning.

With the GraphRAG design, a lot of reasoning is done upfront to generate a corpus with much greater depth later on. This approach is more expensive initially and has longer query times, but it allows for a depth of analysis that other techniques can't achieve. It's definitely a case of choosing the right tool for the right job.
